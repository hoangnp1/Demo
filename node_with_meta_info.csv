9310201;'Generalized Measures in Gauge Theory';'John C. Baez';'Sun, 31 Oct 93 12:09:33 GMT   (10kb)';'   Let P -> M be a principal G-bundle. Using techniques from the loop representation of gauge theory, we construct well-defined substitutes for ``Lebesgue measure'' on the space A of connections on P and for ``Haar measure'' on the group Ga of gauge transformations. More precisely, we define algebras of ``cylinder functions'' on the spaces A, Ga, and A/Ga, and define generalized measures on these spaces as continuous linear functionals on the corresponding algebras. Borrowing some ideas from lattice gauge theory, we characterize generalized measures on A, Ga, and A/Ga in terms of graphs embedded in M. We use this characterization to construct generalized measures on A and Ga, respectively. The ``uniform'' generalized measure on A is invariant under the group of automorphisms of P. It projects down to the generalized measure on A/Ga considered by Ashtekar and Lewandowski in the case G = SU(n). The ``generalized Haar measure'' on Ga is right- and left-invariant as well as Aut(P)-invariant. We show that averaging any generalized measure on A against generalized Haar measure gives a gauge-invariant generalized measure on A. '
9310202;'String Propagation in Gravitational Wave Backgrounds';'E. Kiritsis and C. Kounnas';'Sun, 31 Oct 93 21:43:30 +0100   (13kb)';'   The Conformal Field Theory of the current algebra of the centrally extended 2-d Euclidean group is analyzed. Its representations can be written in terms of four free fields (without background charge) with signature ($-$+++). We construct all irreducible representations of the current algebra with unitary base out of the free fields and their orbifolds. This is used to investigate the spectrum and scattering of strings moving in the background of a gravitational wave. We find that all the dynamics happens in the transverse space or the longitunal one but not both. '
9312201;'On Nonlinear Superconformal Algebras With N > 4';'Z. Khviengia and E. Sezgin';'Tue, 28 Dec 1993 15:24:05 CST   (11kb)';'   We discuss the structure, realizations and quantum BRST operators of a class of nonlinear superconformal algebras with N > 4. '
9312202;'The Perturbative Calculation of the Spin-Spin Correlation Function in';'B. Mikhak and A.M. Zarkesh';'Tue, 28 Dec 93 15:17:32 PST   (8kb)';'   Using the variational formula for operator product coefficients a method for perturbative calculation of the short-distance expansion of the Spin-Spin correlation function in the two dimensional Ising model is presented. Results of explicit calculation up to third order agree with known results from the scaling limit of the lattice calculation. '
9312203;'On Projective Gravity and the vanishing of the Cosmological Constant';'C. Gasparakis';'Tue, 28 Dec 1993 23:08:30 -0500 (EST)   (11kb)';'   We generalize Einstein's Lagrangian in a non-polynomial (in R) way. The usual Lagrangian (linear in R) is the zero $\alpha'$ limit of our theory, where $\alpha'$ is a parameter that is interpreted as the inverse cosmological costant before the Planck time. The theory space of this lagrangian admits a ${\bf Z_{2}}$ modular group, namely $R \leftrightarrow 1/R$. Independence of the modular invariant expectation values from the number of `Big Bangs' enforces a quantization condition for the cosmological constant. At the semiclassical approximation we obtain $\Lambda =0$, and a vacuum equation which is equivalent to inflation cosmology. D=4 and D=1 universes are obtained as unique (and topologically separated by the D=2 semiclassical barrier) integer dimension solutions. They correspond to the first excited level and the ground state respectively of our projective gravity. '
9312204;'Abelian Chern-Simons field theory and anyon equation on a torus';'Kyung-Hyun Cho and Chaiho Rim';'Wed, 29 Dec 93 13:14:49 -0800   (15kb)';'   We quantize the abelian Chern-Simons theory coupled to non-relativistic matter field on a torus without invoking the flux quantization. Through a series of canonical transformations which is equivalent to solving the Gauss constraint, we obtain an effective hamiltonian density with periodic matter field. We also obtain the many-anyon Schr\"odinger equation with periodic Aharonov-Bohm potentials and analyze the periodic property of the wavefunction. Some comments are given on the different features of our approach from the previous ones. '
9312205;'q-def oscillator associated with Calogero model and its q-coherent state';'K.H.Cho, Chaiho Rim, D.S.Soh, S.U. Park';'Wed, 29 Dec 93 16:03:00 -0800   (11kb)';'   We present the q-deformed ^M para-bose oscillators associated with (two-body) Calogero model.^M q-deformed coherent state is also constructed and its resolution of unity ^M is demonstrated. '
9312206;'Renormalization of gauge invariant operators and anomalies in Yang-Mills';'G. Barnich and M. Henneaux';'Wed, 29 Dec 93 12:25:22 MET   (9kb)';'   A long-standing conjecture on the structure of renormalized, gauge invariant, integrated operators of arbitrary dimension in Yang-Mills theory is established. The general solution of the consistency condition for anomalies with sources included is also derived. This is achieved by computing explicitely the cohomology of the full unrestricted BRST operator in the space of local polynomial functionals with ghost number equal to zero or one. The argument does not use power counting and is purely cohomological. It relies crucially on standard properties of the antifield formalism. '
9312207;'Manifestly Finite Perturbation Theory for the Short-Distance Expansion';'B. Mikhak and A.M. Zarkesh';'Wed, 29 Dec 93 13:38:38 PST   (41kb)';'   In the spirit of classic works of Wilson on the renormalization group and operator product expansion, a new framework for the study of the theory space of euclidean quantum field theories has been introduced. This formalism is particularly useful for elucidating the structure of the short-distance expansions of the $n$-point functions of a renormalizable quantum field theory near a non-trivial fixed point. We review and apply this formalism in the study of the scaling limit of the two dimensional massive Ising model. Renormalization group analysis and operator product expansions determine all the non-analytic mass dependence of the short-distance expansion of the correlation functions. An extension of the first order variational formula to higher orders provides a manifestly finite scheme for the perturbative calculation of the operator product coefficients to any order in parameters. A perturbative expansion of the correlation functions follows. We implement this scheme for a systematic study of correlation functions involving two spin operators. We show how the necessary non-trivial integrals can be calculated. As two concrete examples we explicitly calculate the short-distance expansion of the spin-spin correlation function to third order and the spin-spin-energy density correlation function to first order in the mass. We also discuss the applicability of our results to perturbations near other non-trivial fixed points corresponding to other unitary minimal models. '
9312208;'Eigensystem and Full Character Formula of the W_{1+infinity} Algebra';'H. Awata, M. Fukuma, S. Odake and Y.-H. Quano';'Thu, 30 Dec 1993 17:13:41 +0900   (10kb)';'   By using the free field realizations, we analyze the representation theory of the W_{1+infinity} algebra with c=1. The eigenvectors for the Cartan subalgebra of W_{1+infinity} are parametrized by the Young diagrams, and explicitly written down by W_{1+infinity} generators. Moreover, their eigenvalues and full character formula are also obtained. '
9312209;'On Dubrovin Topological Field Theories';'J.-B. Zuber';'30 Dec 93 11:50:06+0100   (15kb)';'   I show that the new topological field theories recently associated by Dubrovin with each Coxeter group may be all obtained in a simple way by a ``restriction'' of the standard ADE solutions. I then study the Chebichev specializations of these topological algebras, examine how the Coxeter graphs and matrices reappear in the dual algebra and mention the intriguing connection with the operator product algebra of conformal field theories. A direct understanding of the occurrence of Coxeter groups in that context is highly desirable. '
9312210;'Generalized Kazakov-Migdal-Kontsevich Model: group theory aspects';'S.Kharchev, A.Marshakov, A.Mironov, A.Morozov';'Fri, 31 Dec 93 17:09 MSK   (34kb)';'   The Kazakov-Migdal model, if considered as a functional of external fields, can be always represented as an expansion over characters of $GL$ group. The integration over "matter fields" can be interpreted as going over the {\it model} (the space of all highest weight representations) of $GL$. In the case of compact unitary groups the integrals should be substituted by {\it discrete} sums over weight lattice. The $D=0$ version of the model is the Generalized Kontsevich integral, which in the above-mentioned unitary (discrete) situation coincides with partition function of the $2d$ Yang-Mills theory with the target space of genus $g=0$ and $m=0,1,2$ holes. This particular quantity is always a bilinear combination of characters and appears to be a Toda-lattice $\tau$-function. (This is generalization of the classical statement that individual $GL$ characters are always singular KP $\tau$-functions.) The corresponding element of the Universal Grassmannian is very simple and somewhat similar to the one, arising in investigations of the $c=1$ string models. However, under certain circumstances the formal sum over representations should be evaluated by steepest descent method and this procedure leads to some more complicated elements of Grassmannian. This "Kontsevich phase" as opposed to the simple "character phase" deserves further investigation. '
9312212;'$2d$ gravity and matrix models. I. $2d$ gravity';'A.Mironov';'Fri, 31 Dec 93 17:34 MSK   (45kb)';'   Some approaches to $2d$ gravity developed for the last years are reviewed. They are physical (Liouville) gravity, topological theories and matrix models. A special attention is paid to matrix models and their interrelations with different approaches. Almost all technical details are omitted, but examples are presented. '
9312213;'On a c-number quantum $\tau$-function';'A. Mironov, A. Morozov, L. Vinet';'Fri, 31 Dec 93 17:43 MSK   (16kb)';'   We first review the properties of the conventional $\tau$-functions of the KP and Toda-lattice hierarchies. A straightforward generalization is then discussed. It corresponds to passing from differential to finite-difference equations; it does not involve however the concept of operator-valued $\tau$-function nor the one associated with non-Cartanian (level $k\ne1$) algebras. The present study could be useful to understand better $q$-free fields and their relation to ordinary free fields. '
9312214;'The representations of Temperley-Lieb-Jones algebras';'R. K. Kaul';'Fri, 31 Dec 1993 14:59:22 +0530 (GMT+5:30)   (16kb)';'   Representations of braid group obtained from rational conformal field theories can be used to obtain explicit representations of Temperley-Lieb-Jones algebras. The method is described in detail for SU(2)$_k$ Wess - Zumino conformal field theories and its generalization to an arbitrary rational conformal field theory outlined. Explicit definition of an associated linear trace operation in terms of a certain matrix element in the space of conformal blocks of such a conformal theory is presented. Further for every primary field of a rational conformal field theory, there is a subfactor of hyperfinite II$_1$ factor with trivial relative commutant. The index of the subfactor is given in terms of identity - identity element of certain duality matrix for conformal blocks of four-point correlators. Jones formula for index ( $<$ 4 ) for subfactors corresponds to spin ${\frac{1}{2}}$ representation of SU(2)$_k$ Wess-Zumino conformal field theory. Definition of the trace operation also provides a method of obtaining link invariants explicitly. '
9312215;'Knot invariants from rational conformal field theories';'P. Ramadevi, T.R. Govindarajan and R.K. Kaul';'Sun, 2 Jan 94 17:19:46+050    (13kb)';'   A framework for studying knot and link invariants from any rational conformal field theory is developed. In particular, minimal models, superconformal models and $W_N$ models are studied. The invariants are related to the invariants obtained from the Wess-Zumino models associated with the coset representations of these models. Possible Chern-Simons representation of these models is also indicated. This generalises the earlier work on knot and link invariants from Chern-Simons theories. '
9405201;'Fusion $U_q(G^{(1)}_2)$ vertex models and analytic Bethe ans{\"a}tze';'Junji Suzuki';'Wed, 1 Jun 94 11:42:21 JST   (10kb)';'   We introduce fusion $U_q(G^{(1)}_2)$ vertex models related to fundamental representations. The eigenvalues of their row to row transfer matrices are derived through analytic Bethe ans{\"a}tze. By combining these results with our previous studies on functional relations among transfer matrices(the $T$-system), we conjecture explicit eigenvalues for a wide class of fusion models. These results can be neatly expressed in terms of a Yangian analogue of the Young tableaux. '
9406201;'Finite Black Hole Entropy and String Theory';'Michael McGuigan';'Wed, 29 Jun 1994 18:32:44 -0400   (12kb)';'   An accelerating observer sees a thermal bath of radiation at the Hawking temperature which is proportional to the acceleration. Also, in string theory there is a Hagedorn temperature beyond which one cannot go without an infinite amount of energy. Several authors have shown that in the context of Hawking radiation a limiting temperature for string theory leads to a limiting acceleration, which for a black hole implies a minimum distance from the horizon for an observer to remain stationary. We argue that this effectively introduces a cutoff in Rindler space or the Schwarzschild geometry inside of which accelerations would exceed this maximum value. Furthermore, this natural cutoff in turn allows one to define a finite entropy for Rindler space or a black hole as all divergences were occurring on the horizon. In all cases if a particular relationship exists between Newton's constant and the string tension then the entropy of the string modes agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. '
9406202;'Quantization of the Gravitational Constant in Odd-Dimensional Gravity';'J.Zanelli';'Tue, 28 Jun 94 15:24:33 CST   (6kb)';'   It is pointed out that the action recently proposed by Ba\~nados et al. for gravitation in odd dimensions higher (and lower) than four, provides a natural quantization for the gravitational constant. These theories possess no dimensionful parameters and hence they may be power counting renormalizable. '
9406203;'Coset Realization of Unifying W-Algebras';'R. Blumenhagen, W. Eholzer, A. Honecker, K. Hornfeck, R. Huebel';'Thu, 30 Jun 94 09:16:49 +0200   (65kb)';'   We construct several quantum coset W-algebras, e.g. sl(2,R)/U(1) and sl(2,R)+sl(2,R) / sl(2,R), and argue that they are finitely nonfreely generated. Furthermore, we discuss in detail their role as unifying W-algebras of Casimir W-algebras. We show that it is possible to give coset realizations of various types of unifying W-algebras, e.g. the diagonal cosets based on the symplectic Lie algebras sp(2n) realize the unifying W-algebras which have previously been introduced as `WD_{-n}'. In addition, minimal models of WD_{-n} are studied. The coset realizations provide a generalization of level-rank-duality of dual coset pairs. As further examples of finitely nonfreely generated quantum W-algebras we discuss orbifolding of W-algebras which on the quantum level has different properties than in the classical case. We demonstrate in some examples that the classical limit according to Bowcock and Watts of these nonfreely finitely generated quantum W-algebras probably yields infinitely nonfreely generated classical W-algebras.

9406204;'Topics in Quantum Dynamics';'A. Jadczyk';'Thu, 30 Jun 94 11:14:56 +0200   (33kb)';'   The paper consists of two parts. In the first part Schroedinger's equation for a charged quantum particle in a Galilei-Newton curved space-time is derived in a fully geometrical way. Gravitational and electromagnetic fields are coded into space metric and space-time connection. The fundamental geometrical object is a quantum connection in a Hermitian line bundle over the 7-dimensional jet space of 3-velocities. The secondary object is the bundle of Hilbert spaces over absolute time. Time appears as a superselection quantity while Shroedinger equation is interpreted as parallel transport in this bundle. In the second part the problem of measurement in quantum theory is discussed as a part of a more general problem of coupling between quantum and classical systems. The standard framework of quantum theory is extended so as to allow for dynamical central observables within dissipative dynamics. It is shown that within this approach one obtains not only Liouville equation that describes statistical ensembles, but also a piecewise-deterministic random process describing sequences of "events" that can be monitored by a continuous observation of the single, coupled classical system. It also describes "quantum jumps" or "wave packet reductions" that accompany these events. Two example are worked out in some details. The last one deals with the problem oof "how to determine the wave function ?". '
9406205;'Bicovariant differential calculus on quantum groups from Poisson Lie';'I. Ya. Aref'eva, G. E. Arutyunov and P. B. Medvedev';'Thu, 30 Jun 94 14:41:56 +0300 (MSD)   (13kb)';'   The aim of this lecture is to give a pedagogical explanation of the notion of a Poisson Lie structure on the external algebra of a Poisson Lie group which was introduced in our previous papers. Using this notion as a guide we construct quantum external algebras on $SL_q(N)$ with proper (classical) dimension. '
9406206;'A Canonical Approach to Duality Transformations';'E. Alvarez, L. Alvarez-Gaume and Y. Lozano';'Thu, 30 Jun 94 15:12:11 +0100   (11kb)';'   We show that Buscher's abelian duality transformation rules can be recovered in a very simple way by performing a canonical transformation first suggested by Giveon, Rabinovici and Veneziano. We explore the properties of this transformation, and also discuss some aspects of non-abelian duality. '
9406207;'String Field Theory in the Temporal Gauge';'M. Ikehara, N. Ishibashi, H. kawai, T. Mogami, R. Nakayama and N.';'Thu, 30 Jun 1994 23:17:28 +0900   (29kb)';'   We construct the string field Hamiltonian for $c=1-\frac{6}{m(m+1)}$ string theory in the temporal gauge. In order to do so, we first examine the Schwinger-Dyson equations of the matrix chain models and propose the continuum version of them. Results of boundary conformal field theory are useful in making a connection between the discrete and continuum pictures. The $W$ constraints are derived from the continuum Schwinger-Dyson equations. We also check that these equations are consistent with other known results about noncritical string theory. The string field Hamiltonian is easily obtained from the continuum Schwinger-Dyson equations. It looks similar to Kaku-Kikkawa's Hamiltonian and may readily be generalized to $c>1$ cases. '
9406208;'"Topological" Formulation of Effective Vortex Strings';'Masatoshi Sato and Shigeaki Yahikozawa';'Fri, 01 Jul 94 00:50:39 +0900   (31kb)';'   We present a ``topological'' formulation of arbitrarily shaped vortex strings in four dimensional field theory. By using a large Higgs mass expansion, we then evaluate the effective action of the closed Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen vortex string. It is shown that the effective action contains the Nambu-Goto term and an extrinsic curvature squared term with negative sign. We next evaluate the topological $\FtF$ term and find that it becomes the sum of an ordinary self-intersection number and Polyakov's self-intersection number of the world sheet swept by the vortex string. These self-intersection numbers are related to the self-linking number and the total twist number, respectively. Furthermore, the $\FtF$ term turns out to be the difference between the sum of the writhing numbers and the linking numbers of the vortex strings at the initial time and the one at the final time. When the vortex string is coupled to fermions, the chiral fermion number of the vortex string becomes the writhing number (modulo $\bZ$) through the chiral anomaly. Our formulation is also applied to ``global'' vortex strings in a model with a broken global $U(1)$ symmetry. '
9406209;'Remarks on Thermal Strings outside Black Holes';'J.L.F. Barbon';'Thu, 30 Jun 94 12:11:31 -0400   (14kb)';'   We discuss the semiclassical approximation to the level density of (super) strings propagating in non-compact coset manifolds $G/H$. We show that the WKB ansatz agrees with heuristic red-shift arguments with respect to the ``exact" sigma model metric, up to some deviations from minimal coupling, parametrized by the dilaton. This approximation is used to study thermal ensembles of free strings in black holes, with the ``brick wall" regularization of `t Hooft. In two dimensions the entropy diverges logarithmically with the horizon thickness, and a local Hagedorn transition occurs in higher dimensional models. We also observe that supersymmetry improves the regularity of strings at the horizon. '
9406210;'Entropy for dilatonic black hole';'A. Ghosh and P. Mitra (Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics)';'Thu, 30 Jun 94 11:05 GMT   (6kb)';'   The area formula for entropy is extended to the case of a dilatonic black hole. The entropy of a scalar field in the background of such a black hole is calculated semiclassically. The area and cutoff dependences are normal {\it except in the extremal case}, where the area is zero but the entropy nonzero. '
9406211;'Representation theory and tensor product theory for vertex operator';'Hai-sheng Li';'Thu, 30 Jun 94 22:10:13 EDT   (64kb)';'   We first formulate a definition of tensor product for two modules for a vertex operator algebra in terms of a certain universal property and then we give a construction of tensor products. We prove the unital property of the adjoint module and the commutativity of tensor products, up to module isomorphism. We relate this tensor product construction with Frenkel and Zhu's $A(M)$-theory. We give a proof of a formula of Frenkel and Zhu for fusion rules. We also give the analogue of the ``Hom''-functor of classical Lie algebra theory for vertex operator algebra theory by introducing a notion of ``generalized intertwining operator.'' We prove that the space of generalized intertwining operators from one module to another for a vertex operator algebra is a generalized module. From this result we derive a general form of Tsuchiya and Kanie's ``nuclear democracy theorem'' for any rational vertex operator algebra. This proves that the fusion rules obtained from our construction of tensor products are the same as the fusion rules obtained by using Tsuchiya and Kanie's method, for both WZW models and minimal models. We prove that if $V$ satisfies certain ``finiteness'' and ``semisimplicity'' conditions, then there exists a unique maximal submodule inside the generalized module. Furthermore, we prove that this maximal submodule is isomorphic to the contragredient module of a certain tensor product module. This gives another construction of tensor product modules and this result turns out to be closely related to Huang and Lepowsky's construction. '
9406212;'Perturbative Renormalizations of Anyon Quantum Mechanics';'G. Amelino-Camelia';'Thu, 30 Jun 1994 13:28:16 -0400   (18kb)';'   In bosonic end perturbative calculations for quantum mechanical anyon systems a regularization and renormalization procedure, analogous to those used in field theory, is necessary. I examine the reliability and the physical interpretation of the most commonly used bosonic end regularization procedures. I then use the regularization procedure with the most transparent physical interpretation to derive some bosonic end perturbation theory results on anyon spectra, including a 3-anyon ground state energy. '
9406213;'Schroedinger Self-adjoint Extension and Quantum Field Theory';'G. Amelino-Camelia and D. Bak';'Thu, 30 Jun 1994 13:30:35 -0400   (15kb)';'   We argue that the results obtained using the quantum mechanical method of self-adjoint extension of the Schr\"odinger Hamiltonian can also be derived using Feynman perturbation theory in the investigation of the corresponding non-relativistic field theories. We show that this is indeed what happens in the study of an anyon system, and, in doing so, we establish a field theoretical description for ``colliding anyons", {\it i.e.} anyons whose quantum mechanical wave functions satisfy the non-conventional boundary conditions obtained with the method of self-adjoint extension. We also show that analogous results hold for a system of non-abelian Chern-Simons particles. '
9406214;'The Supersymmetric Two Boson Hierarchies';'J. C. Brunelli and A. Das';'Thu, 30 Jun 1994 13:56:06 -0500 (EST)   (6kb)';'   We construct the most general supersymmetric two boson system that is integrable. We obtain the Lax operator and the nonstandard Lax representation for this system. We show that, under appropriate redefinition of variables, this reduces to the supersymmetric nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation without any arbitrary parameter which is known to be integrable. We show that this supersymmetric system has three local Hamiltonian structures just like the bosonic counterpart and we show how the supersymmetric KdV equation can be embedded into this system. '
9406215;'Quantum integrability of nonultralocal models through Baxterisation of';'Ladislav Hlavaty and Anjan Kundu';'Thu, 30 Jun 1994 20:50:39 MEZ ( +0100)   (17kb)';'   A scheme suitable for describing quantum nonultralocal models including supersymmetric ones is proposed. Braided algebras are generalised to be used through Baxterisation for constructing braided quantum Yang--Baxter equations.   Supersymmetric and some known nonultralocal models are derived in the framework of the present approach. '
9406216;'Low energy effective string cosmology';'E. J. Copeland, Amitabha Lahiri and David Wands';'Thu, 30 Jun 1994 19:49:38 +0100 (BST)   (35kb)';'   We give the general analytic solutions derived from the low energy string effective action for four dimensional Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models with dilaton and antisymmetric tensor field, considering both long and short wavelength modes of the $H$-field. The presence of a homogeneous $H$-field significantly modifies the evolution of the scale factor and dilaton. In particular it places a lower bound on the allowed value of the dilaton. The scale factor also has a lower bound but our solutions remain singular as they all contain regions where the spacetime curvature diverges signalling a breakdown in the validity of the effective action. We extend our results to the simplest Bianchi I metric in higher dimensions with only two scale factors. We again give the general analytic solutions for long and short wavelength modes for the $H$ field restricted to the three dimensional space, which produces an anisotropic expansion. In the case of $H$ field radiation (wavelengths within the Hubble length) we obtain the usual four dimensional radiation dominated FRW model as the unique late time attractor. '
9406217;'Matter couplings in partially broken extended supersymmetry';'J. Bagger and A. Galperin';'Thu, 30 Jun 94 14:58:46 -0500   (10kb)';'   We use nonlinear realizations to describe the spontaneous breaking of $N=2$ supersymmetry to $N=1$ in four dimensions. We identify the Goldstone multiplet with an $N=1$ chiral superfield, and show that chiral $N=1$ matter is consistent with the partially broken $N=2$ supersymmetry. We find that the chiral matter can be in any representation of the gauge group; no mirror particles are required. We present the Goldstone action and the general couplings to $N=1$ matter to the first nontrivial order in the scale of symmetry breaking. '
9410201;'Linear Connections in Non-Commutative Geometry';'J. Mourad';'Wed, 26 Oct 1994 19:50:59 GMT   (10kb)';'   A construction is proposed for linear connections on non-commutative algebras. The construction relies on a generalisation of the Leibnitz rules of commutative geometry and uses the bimodule structure of $\Omega^1$. A special role is played by the extension to the framework of non-commutative geometry of the permutation of two copies of $\Omega^1$. The construction of the linear connection as well as the definition of torsion and curvature is first proposed in the setting of the derivations based differential calculus of Dubois- Violette and then a generalisation to the framework proposed by Connes as well as other non-commutative differential calculi is suggested. The covariant derivative obtained admits an extension to the tensor product of several copies of $\Omega^1$. These constructions are illustrated with the example of the algebra of $ n \times n$ matrices. '
9410202;'Octonion X-product orbits';'Geoffrey Dixon';'Wed, 26 Oct 1994 15:27 EDT   (9kb)';'   The octonionic X-product gives the octonions a flexibility not found in the other real division algebras. The pattern of that flexibility is investigated here. '
9410203;'Regular Conjugacy Classes in the Weyl Group and Integrable Hierarchies';'F. Delduc and L. Feher';'Thu, 27 Oct 94 14:02:58 +0100   (45kb)';'   Generalized KdV hierarchies associated by Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction to grade one regular semisimple elements from non-equivalent Heisenberg subalgebras of a loop algebra $\G\otimes{\bf C}[\lambda,\lambda^{-1}]$ are studied. The graded Heisenberg subalgebras containing such elements are labelled by the regular conjugacy classes in the Weyl group ${\bf W}(\G)$ of the simple Lie algebra $\G$. A representative $w\in {\bf W}(\G)$ of a regular conjugacy class can be lifted to an inner automorphism of $\G$ given by $\hat w=\exp\left(2i\pi {\rm ad I_0}/m\right)$, where $I_0$ is the defining vector of an $sl_2$ subalgebra of $\G$.The grading is then defined by the operator $d_{m,I_0}=m\lambda {d\over d\lambda} + {\rm ad} I_0$ and any grade one regular element $\Lambda$ from the Heisenberg subalgebra associated to $[w]$ takes the form $\Lambda = (C_+ +\lambda C_-)$, where $[I_0, C_-]=-(m-1) C_-$ and $C_+$ is included in an $sl_2$ subalgebra containing $I_0$. The largest eigenvalue of ${\rm ad}I_0$ is $(m-1)$ except for some cases in $F_4$, $E_{6,7,8}$. We explain how these Lie algebraic results follow from known results and apply them to construct integrable systems.If the largest ${\rm ad} I_0$ eigenvalue is $(m-1)$, then using any grade one regular element from the Heisenberg subalgebra associated to $[w]$ we can construct a KdV system possessing the standard $\W$-algebra defined by $I_0$ as its second Poisson bracket algebra. For $\G$ a classical Lie algebra, we derive pseudo-differential Lax operators for those non-principal KdV systems that can be obtained as discrete reductions of KdV systems related to $gl_n$. Non-abelian Toda systems are also considered. '

9410205;'S-Dual Gaugino Condensation and Supersymmetry Breaking';'Z. Lalak, A. Niemeyer and H.P. Nilles';'Thu, 27 Oct 1994 12:15:54 +0100   (12kb)';'   The principle of S-duality is used to incorporate gaugino condensates into effective supergravity (superstring) Lagrangians. We discuss two implementations of S-duality which differ in the way the coupling constant is transformed. Both solve the problem of the runaway dilaton and lead to satisfactory supersymmetry breaking in models with a {\em single} gaugino condensate. The breakdown of supersymmetry is intimately related to a nontrivial transformation of the condensate under T-duality. '
9410206;'String GUTs';'G. Aldazabal, A. Font, L.E. Ibanez and A.M. Uranga';'Thu, 27 Oct 94 15:21:56 HOE   (42kb)';'   Standard SUSY-GUTs such as those based on $SU(5)$ or $SO(10)$ lead to predictions for the values of $\alpha _s$ and $sin^2\theta _W$ in amazing agreement with experiment. In this article we investigate how these models may be obtained from string theory, thus bringing them into the only known consistent framework for quantum gravity. String models with matter in standard GUT representations require the realization of affine Lie algebras at higher levels. We start by describing some methods to build level $k=2$ orbifold string models with gauge groups $SU(5)$ or $SO(10)$. We present several examples and identify generic features of the type of models constructed. Chiral fields appropriate to break the symmetry down to the standard model generically appear in the massless spectrum. However, unlike in standard SUSY-GUTs, they often behave as string moduli, i.e., they do not have self-couplings. We also discuss briefly the doublet-triplet Higgs splitting. We find that, in some models, built-in sliding-singlet type of couplings exist. '
9410207;'Diff invariant Poincare transformations as deformation of Poincare';'M.Pitk\"anen';'Thu, 27 Oct 1994 17:17:59 +0200 (EET)   (5kb)';'   The concept of $Diff^4$ invariant Poincare transformations is a cornerstone of T(opological) G(eometro)D(ynamics). This concept makes it possible to understand the concept of subjective time and irreversibelity as well as nontriviality of S-matrix at quantum level. In this paper the possibility of identifying $Diff^4$ invariant Poincare transformations as the recently discovered Lorentz invariant deformation of Poincare algebra with the basic property that 'new' energy is some function of 'old' energy, is considered.

9410208;'On spectral theory of quantum vertex operators';'Pavel Etingof';'Thu, 27 Oct 94 11:29:01 EDT   (12kb)';'   In this note we prove the Davies-Foda-Jimbo-Miwa-Nakayashiki conjecture on the asymptotics of the composition of n quantum vertex operators for the quantum affine algebra U_q(\hat sl_2), as n goes to infinity. For this purpose we define and study the leading eigenvalue and eigenvector of the product of two components of the quantum vertex operator. This eigenvector and the corresponding eigenvalue were recently computed by M.Jimbo. The results of his computation are given in Section 4. '
9410209;'On Structure Constants of $sl(2)$ Theories';'V. B. Petkova and J.-B. Zuber';'27 Oct 94 16:37:45+0100   (30kb)';'   Structure constants of minimal conformal theories are reconsidered. It is shown that {\it ratios} of structure constants of spin zero fields of a non-diagonal theory over the same evaluated in the diagonal theory are given by a simple expression in terms of the components of the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix of the corresponding Dynkin diagram. This is proved by inspection, which leads us to carefully determine the {\it signs} of the structure constants that had not all appeared in the former works on the subject. We also present a proof relying on the consideration of lattice correlation functions and speculate on the extension of these identities to more complicated theories. '
9410210;'Classical/Quantum Duality';'M. J. Duff';'Thu, 27 Oct 94 16:16:25 GMT   (4kb)';'   String theory requires two kinds of loop expansion: classical $(\alpha')$ worldsheet loops with expansion parameter $<T>$ where $T$ is a modulus field, and quantum $(\hbar)$ spacetime loops with expansion parameter $<S>$ where $S$ is the dilaton field. Four-dimensional string/string duality (a corollary of ten-dimensional string/fivebrane duality) interchanges the roles of $S$ and $T$ and hence interchanges classical and quantum. '
9410212;'Curved Four-Dimensional Spacetime as Infrared Regulator in Superstring';'E. Kiritsis, C. Kounnas';'Thu, 27 Oct 94 20:00:19 +0100   (17kb)';'   We construct a new class of exact and stable superstring solutions in which our four-dimensional spacetime is taken to be curved . We derive in this space the full one-loop partition function in the presence of non-zero $\langle F^a_{\mu\nu}F_a^{\mu\nu}\rangle=F^2$ gauge background as well as in an $\langle R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\rangle=\R^2$ gravitational background and we show that the non-zero curvature, $Q^2=2/(k+2)$, of the spacetime provides an infrared regulator for all $\langle[F^a_{\mu\nu}]^n[R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}]^m\rangle$ correlation functions. The string one-loop partition function $Z(F,\R, Q)$ can be exactly computed, and it is IR and UV finite. For $Q$ small we have thus obtained an IR regularization, consistent with spacetime supersymmetry (when $F=0,\R=0$) and modular invariance. Thus, it can be used to determine, without any infrared ambiguities, the one-loop string radiative corrections on gravitational, gauge or Yukawa couplings necessary for the string superunification predictions at low energies.

We find one-cut solutions of the loop equations for the correlators of these models and show that they exhibit third order phase transitions associated with $m$-th order multi-critical points with string susceptibility exponents $\gamma_{\rm str}=-1/m$. We also find critical points which can be interpreted as points of first order phase transitions, and we discuss the implications of this critical behaviour for the topological expansion of these matrix models.

It is argued that a Hagedorn transition occurs nears the horizon for all N>1. '
9410216;'4D Edge Currents from 5D Chern-Simons Theory';'K.S.Gupta and A.Stern';'Thu, 27 Oct 1994 20:29:48 CDT   (18kb)';'   A class of two dimensional conformal field theories is known to correspond to three dimensional Chern-Simons theory. Here we claim that there is an analogous class of four dimensional field theories corresponding to five dimensional Chern-Simons theory. The four dimensional theories give a coupling between a scalar field and an external divergenceless vector field and they may have some application in magnetohydrodynamics. Like in conformal theories they possess a diffeomorphism symmetry, which for us is along the direction of the vector field, and their generators are analogous to Virasoro generators. Our analysis of the abelian Chern-Simons system uses elementary canonical methods for the quantization of field theories defined on manifolds with boundaries. Edge states appear for these systems and they yield a four dimensional current algebra. We examine the quantization of these algebras in several special cases and claim that a renormalization of the $5D$ Chern-Simons coupling is necessary for removing divergences. '
9410217;'Integrable Systems in Stringy Gravity';'D.V. Gal'tsov';'Fri, 28 Oct 1994 13:29:40   (8kb)';'   Static axisymmetric Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton and stationary axisymmetric Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA) theories in four space-time dimensions are shown to be integrable by means of the inverse scattering transform method. The proof is based on the coset-space representation of the 4-dim theory in a space-time admitting a Killing vector field. Hidden symmetry group of the four-dimensional EMDA theory, unifying T and S string dualities, is shown to be Sp(2, R) acting transitively on the coset Sp(2, R)/U(2). In the case of two-parameter Abelian space-time isometry group, the hidden symmetry is the corresponding infinite-dimensional group of the Geroch-Kinnersley-Chitre type. '
9410219;'Semi-Classical Quantization of Circular Strings in De Sitter and Anti De';'H.J. de Vega, A.L. Larsen and N. Sanchez';'Fri, 28 Oct 1994 12:51:11 +0002   (14kb)';'   We compute the {\it exact} equation of state of circular strings in the (2+1) dimensional de Sitter (dS) and anti de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes, and analyze its properties for the different (oscillating, contracting and expanding) strings. The string equation of state has the perfect fluid form $P=(\gamma-1)E,$ with the pressure and energy expressed closely and completely in terms of elliptic functions, the instantaneous coefficient $\gamma$ depending on the elliptic modulus. We semi-classically quantize the oscillating circular strings. The string mass is $m=\sqrt{C}/(\pi H\alpha'),\;C$ being the Casimir operator, $C=-L_{\mu\nu}L^{\mu\nu},$ of the $O(3,1)$-dS [$O(2,2)$-AdS] group, and $H$ is the Hubble constant. We find $\alpha'm^2_{\mbox{dS}}\approx 5.9n,\;(n\in N_0),$ and a {\it finite} number of states $N_{\mbox{dS}}\approx 0.17/(H^2\alpha')$ in de Sitter spacetime; $m^2_{\mbox{AdS}}\approx 4H^2n^2$ (large $n\in N_0$) and $N_{\mbox{AdS}}=\infty$ in anti de Sitter spacetime. The level spacing grows with $n$ in AdS spacetime, while is approximately constant (although larger than in Minkowski spacetime) in dS spacetime. The massive states in dS spacetime decay through tunnel effect and the semi-classical decay probability is computed. The semi-classical quantization of {\it exact} (circular) strings and the canonical quantization of generic string perturbations around the string center of mass strongly agree. '

The first class, which was already considered in the literature, consists of solutions with a (conformally) flat metric coupled to axionic instantons. The second includes Asymptotically Locally Euclidean (ALE) gravitational instantonic backgrounds coupled to gauge instantons through the so--called ``standard embedding''.

9410223;'Higher covariant derivative Pauli-Villars regularization does not lead';'C.P. Martin and F. Ruiz Ruiz';'Fri, 28 Oct 1994 14:39:34 +0100   (33kb)';'   We compute the beta function at one loop for Yang-Mills theory using as regulator the combination of higher covariant derivatives and Pauli-Villars determinants proposed by Faddeev and Slavnov. This regularization prescription has the appealing feature that it is manifestly gauge invariant and essentially four-dimensional. It happens however that the one-loop coefficient in the beta function that it yields is not $-11/3,$ as it should be, but $-23/6.$ The difference is due to unphysical logarithmic radiative corrections generated by the Pauli-Villars determinants on which the regularization method is based. This no-go result discards the prescription as a viable gauge invariant regularization, thus solving a long-standing open question in the literature. We also observe that the prescription can be modified so as to not generate unphysical logarithmic corrections, but at the expense of losing manifest gauge invariance. '

This evidences the existence of BRST charges for a kind of soft-type algebras which can be constructed from two copies of quantum $\W_{2,s}$ algebras, (s=3,4,5,6,8). '
9410225;'Relativistic Aharonov-Bohm-Coulomb Problem';'C.R. Hagen and D.K.

Scalar and vector couplings are each considered. It is found that the approach in which the flux tube is given a finite radius that is taken to zero only after a matching of boundary conditions does not give physically meaningful results. Specifically, the operations of taking the limit of zero flux tube radius and the Galilean limit do not commute. Thus there appears to be no satisfactory solution of the relativistic Aharonov-Bohm-Coulomb problem using the finite radius flux tube method. '
9410226;'The Bosonic String Measure at Two and Three Loops and Symplectic';'Simon Davis';'Fri, 28 Oct 94 23:45 GMT   (6kb)';'   Symplectic modular invariance of the bosonic string partition function has been verified at genus 2 and 3 using the period matrix coordinatization of moduli space. A calculation of the transformation of the holomorphic part of the differential volume element shows that an extra phase arises together with the factor associated with a specific modular weight; the phase is cancelled in the transformation of the entire volume element including the complex conjugate. An argument is given for modular invariance of the reggeon measure at genus twelve. '
9410228;'Integrable many-body problems from the field theories';'Alexander Gorsky';'Sat, 29 Oct 94 13:58:12 +0100   (29kb)';'   We review recent results which clarify the role of the integrable many-body problems in the quantum field theory framework.They describe the dynamics of the topological degrees of freedom in the theories which are obtained by perturbing the topological ones by the proper Hamiltonians and sources. Interpretation of the many-body dynamics as a motion on the different moduli spaces as well as the property of duality is discussed.Tower of many-body systems can be derived from a tower of the field theories with appropriate phase spaces which have a transparent interpretation in terms of the group theory.The appearance of Calogero-type systems in different physical phenomena is mentioned.

We prove that when the original configuration has unbroken space-time supersymmetries, the dual configuration also does if a special condition is met: the Killing spinors of the original configuration have to be independent on the coordinate which corresponds to the isometry direction of the bosonic fields used for duality. Examples of ``losers" (T-duals are not supersymmetric) and ``winners" (T-duals are supersymmetric) are given. '

The resultant coupling constants are severely restricted by the model and in good agreement with the data. When applied to the Skyrme model, our scheme reproduces the non-Skyrme term with the right coefficient. We comment on a similar treatment of the linear $\sigma $-model. '
9410232;'generalised q-deformed oscillators and their statistics';'Dao Vong Duc';'Mon, 31 Oct 94 15:12:35 MET   (6kb)';'   We consider a version of generalised $q$-oscillators and some of their applications. The generalisation includes also "quons" of infinite statistics and deformed oscillators of parastatistics. The statistical distributions for different $q$-oscillators are derived for their corresponding Fock space representations. The deformed Virasoro algebra and SU(2) algebra are also treated. '
9410233;'$c_M<1$ String Theory as a Constrained Topological Sigma Model';'Pablo M. Llatas and Shibaji Roy';'Mon, 31 Oct 94 16:03:38 +0100   (10kb)';'   It has been argued by Ishikawa and Kato that by making use of a specific bosonization, $c_M=1$ string theory can be regarded as a constrained topological sigma model. We generalize their construction for any $(p,q)$ minimal model coupled to two dimensional (2d) gravity and show that the energy--momentum tensor and the topological charge of a constrained topological sigma model can be mapped to the energy--momentum tensor and the BRST charge of $c_M<1$ string theory at zero cosmological constant. We systematically study the physical state spectrum of this topological sigma model and recover the spectrum in the absolute cohomology of $c_M<1$ string theory. This procedure provides us a manifestly topological representation of the continuum Liouville formulation of $c_M<1$ string theory. '

Hansson and Rodanthy Tzani';'Mon, 31 Oct 94 20:40:04 gmt   (17kb)';'   Using a loop formulation approach of QCD$_2$, we study the potential between two heavy quarks in the presence of adjoint scalar fields, and demonstrate how 't Hooft's planar rule is manifested in this formulation. Based on some physical assumptions, we argue that large adjoint loops ``confined'' inside an external fundamental one give a Casimir type contribution to the potential energy, while the small loops only renormalize the string tension. We also extend the results to the case of massive adjoint fields. '
9410236;'On a non-CP-violating electric dipole moment of elementary particles';'J. Giesen';'Mon, 31 Oct 1994 17:15:44 +0200   (6kb)';'   A description of elementary particles should be based on irreducible representations of the Poincar\'e group. In the theory of massive representations of the full Poincar\'e group there are essentially four different cases. One of them corresponds to the ordinary Dirac theory. The extension of Dirac theory to the remaining three cases makes it possible to describe an anomalous electric dipole moment of elementary particles without breaking the reflections. '
9410237;'An Introduction to T-Duality in String Theory';'E. Alvarez, L. Alvarez-Gaume and Y. Lozano';'Mon, 31 Oct 94 19:20:13 +0100   (38kb)';'   In these lectures a general introduction to T-duality is given. In the abelian case the approaches of Buscher, and Ro\u{c}ek and Verlinde are reviewed. Buscher's prescription for the dilaton transformation is recovered from a careful definition of the gauge integration measure. It is also shown how duality can be understood as a quite simple canonical transformation. Some aspects of non-abelian duality are also discussed, in particular what is known on relation to canonical transformations. Some implications of the existence of duality on the cosmological constant and the definition of distance in String Theory are also suggested. '
9410238;'Basic structures of the covariant canonical formalism for fields based';'Igor V. Kanatchikov';'Mon, 31 Oct 1994 21:15:09 +0100 (MET)   (13kb)';'   We discuss a field theoretical extension of the basic structures of classical analytical mechanics within the framework of the De Donder--Weyl (DW) covariant Hamiltonian formulation. The analogue of the symplectic form is argued to be the {\em polysymplectic} form of degree $(n+1)$, where $n$ is the dimension of space-time, which defines a map between multivector fields or, more generally, graded derivation operators on exterior algebra, and forms of various degrees which play a role of dynamical variables. The Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket on multivector fields induces the graded analogue of the Poisson bracket on forms, which turns the exterior algebra of (horizontal) forms to a Gerstenhaber algebra. The equations of motion are written in terms of the Poisson bracket on forms and it is argued that the bracket with $H\vol$, where $H$ is the DW Hamiltonian function and $\vol$ is the horizontal (i.e. space-time) volume form, is related to the operation of exterior differentiation of forms.

In the zero longitudinal momentum sector of the theory a general gauge fixing is performed and the corresponding relations that determine the constrained modes of the gauge field are obtained. The constraints are solved perturbatively and the structure of the theory is studied to lowest nontrivial order.

9410241;'Introduction to Braided Geometry and $q$-Minkowski Space';'Shahn Majid';'Tue, 1 Nov 94 00:00:32 GMT   (85kb)';'   We present a systematic introduction to the geometry of linear braided spaces. These are versions of $\R^n$ in which the coordinates $x_i$ have braid-statistics described by an R-matrix. From this starting point we survey the author's braided-approach to $q$-deformation: braided differentiation, exponentials, Gaussians, integration and forms, i.e. the basic ingredients for $q$-deformed physics are covered. The braided approach includes natural $q$-Euclidean and $q$-Minkowski spaces in R-matrix form. '
9410242;'A Scheme Independent Definition of $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$';'Hidenori Sonoda';'Mon, 31 Oct 94 18:14:41 -0800   (3kb)';'   Given a renormalization scheme of QCD, one can define a mass scale $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$ in terms of the beta function. Under a change of the renormalization scheme, however, $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$ changes by a multiplicative constant. We introduce a scheme independent $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$ using a connection on the space of the coupling constant. '
9410243;'Light Front Hamiltonian for Transverse Lattice QCD';'Paul A. Griffin';'Mon, 31 Oct 1994 21:21:17 -0500   (8kb)';'   A calculational framework for determining masses of low lying hadrons using light front quantization is discussed. The method is based upon four theoretical tools: discrete light cone quantization, which has been very successful in 1+1 dimensional models, a projector Monte Carlo method to extract low lying state data with 2 additional transverse dimensions, the transverse spatial lattice Hamiltonian of QCD, and exact form factors of the SU(3) x SU(3) 1+1 dimensional non-linear sigma model (NLSM). How these tools are to be put together to provide a description of hadrons is the main topic of this lecture. I also focus on the NLSM form factors, which are given new physical relevance via this picture of QCD.

9411201;'Thirring Model as a Gauge Theory';'Taichi Itoh, Yoonbai Kim, Masaki Sugiura, and Koichi Yamawaki';'Mon, 28 Nov 1994 22:30:58 +0900   (26kb)';'   We reformulate the Thirring model in $D$ $(2 \le D < 4)$ dimensions as a gauge theory by introducing $U(1)$ hidden local symmetry (HLS) and study the dynamical mass generation of the fermion through the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equation. By virtue of such a gauge symmetry we can greatly simplify the analysis of the SD equation by taking the most appropriate gauge (``nonlocal gauge'') for the HLS.   In the case of even-number of (2-component) fermions, we find the dynamical fermion mass generation as the second order phase transition at certain fermion number, which breaks the chiral symmetry but preserves the parity in (2+1) dimensions ($D=3$). In the infinite four-fermion coupling (massless gauge boson) limit in (2+1) dimensions, the result coincides with that of the (2+1)-dimensional QED, with the critical number of the 4-component fermion being $N_{\rm cr} = \frac{128}{3\pi^{2}}$. As to the case of odd-number (2-component) fermion in (2+1) dimensions, the regularization ambiguity on the induced Chern-Simons term may be resolved by specifying the regularization so as to preserve the HLS.   Our method also applies to the (1+1) dimensions, the result being consistent with the exact solution. The bosonization mechanism in (1+1) dimensional Thirring model is also reproduced in the context of dual-transformed theory for the HLS. '
9411202;'Conserved currents and gauge invariance in Yang-Mills theory';'Glenn Barnich, Friedemann Brandt and Marc Henneaux';'Mon, 28 Nov 94 16:19:03 CET   (10kb)';'   It is shown that in the absence of free abelian gauge fields, the conserved currents of (classical) Yang-Mills gauge models coupled to matter fields can be always redefined so as to be gauge invariant. This is a direct consequence of the general analysis of the Wess-Zumino consistency condition for Yang-Mills theory that we have provided recently. '

They are suggested by the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz approach to the Renormalization Group flow of 2D integrable, ADE-related quantum field theories. The known sum rules for the central charge of critical fixed points can be obtained as special cases of these. We conjecture that similar functional identities can be constructed for any rational integrable quantum field theory with factorized S-matrix and support it with extensive numerical checks. '
9411204;'c>1 Non-Critical Strings and Large-N Matrix Field Theory';'F.Antonuccio and S.Dalley';'Mon, 28 Nov 1994 18:37:08 +0000 (GMT)   (17kb)';'   Motivated by a possible relativistic string description of hadrons we use a discretised light-cone quantisation and Lanczos algorithm to investigate the phase structure of phi^3 matrix field theory in the large N limit. In 1+1 dimensions we confirm the existence of Polyakov's non-critical string theory at the boundary between parton-like and string-like phases, finding critical exponents for longitudinal oscillations equal to or consistent with those given by a mean field argument. The excitation spectrum is finite, possibly discrete. We calculate light-cone structure functions and find evidence that the probability Q(x) of a parton in the string carrying longitudinal momentum fraction between x and x+dx has support on all 0<x<1, despite the average number of partons being infinite.

9411205;'Gauged Hyperinstantons and Monopole Equations';'Damiano Anselmi and Pietro Fre'';'Mon, 28 Nov 1994 13:57:01 -0500   (14kb)';'   The monopole equations in the dual abelian theory of the N=2 gauge-theory, recently proposed by Witten as a new tool to study topological invariants, are shown to be the simplest elements in a class of instanton equations that follow from the improved topological twist mechanism introduced by the authors in previous papers. When applied to the N=2 sigma-model, this twisting procedure suggested the introduction of the so-called hyperinstantons, or triholomorphic maps. When gauging the sigma-model by coupling it to the vector multiplet of a gauge group G, one gets gauged hyperinstantons that reduce to the Seiberg-Witten equations in the flat case and G=U(1). The deformation of the self-duality condition on the gauge-field strength due to the monopole-hyperinstanton is very similar to the deformation of the self-duality condition on the Riemann curvature previously observed by the authors when the hyperinstantons are coupled to topological gravity. In this paper the general form of the hyperinstantonic equations coupled to both gravity and gauge multiplets is presented. '
9411206;'Nodes as Composite Operators in Matrix Models';'Damiano Anselmi';'Mon, 28 Nov 1994 15:13:41 -0500   (20kb)';'   Riemann surfaces with nodes can be described by introducing simple composite operators in matrix models. In the case of the Kontsevich model, it is sufficient to add the quadratic, but ``non-propagating'', term (tr[X])^2 to the Lagrangian. The corresponding Jenkins-Strebel differentials have pairwise identified simple poles. The result is in agreement with a conjecture formulated by Kontsevich and recently investigated by Arbarello and Cornalba that the set ${\cal M}_{m*,s}$ of ribbon graphs with s faces and $m*=(m_0,m_1,\ldots,m_j,\ldots)$ vertices of valencies $(1,3,\ldots,2j+1,\ldots)$ ``can be expressed in terms of Mumford-Morita classes'': one gets an interpretation for univalent vertices. I also address the possible relationship with a recently formulated theory of constrained topological gravity. '

Bougourzi';'Mon, 28 Nov 94 16:28:09 -0500   (13kb)';'   We extend the concept of conjugate vertex operators, first introduced by Dotsenko in the case of the bosonization of the $su(2)$ conformal field theory, to the bosonization of the dynamical vertex operators (type II in the classification of the Kyoto school) of the higher spin XXZ model. We show that the introduction of the conjugate vertex operators leads to simpler expressions for the N-point matrix elements of the dynamical vertex operators, that is, without redundant Jackson integrals that arise from the insertion of screening charges. In particular, the two-point matrix element can be represented without any integral. '

First, we evaluate in our model the effective potential of two composite scalars in the linear curvature approximation using a local momentum representation in curved spacetime for the higher-derivative propagator which naturally appears. The symmetry breaking phenomenon and phase transition induced by curvature are numerically investigated. A numerical study of the dynamically generated fermionic mass, which depends on the coupling constants and on the curvature, is also presented. '
9411217;'Classical Solutions of 2D String Theory in any Curved Spacetime';'Itzhak Bars';'Tue, 29 Nov 1994 06:32:35 -0800   (73kb)';'   The complete set of solutions of two dimensional classical string theory are constructed for any curved spacetime. They describe folded strings moving in curved spacetime. Surprizing stringy behavior becomes evident at singularities such as black holes.The solutions are given in the form ofa map from the world sheet to target spacetime, where the world sheet has to be divided into lattice -like patches corresponding to different maps. A recursion relation analogous to a transfer matrix connects these maps into a single continuous map. This ``transfer matrix'' encodes the properties of the world sheet lattice as well as the geometry of spacetime. The solutions are completely classified by their behavior in the asymptotically flat region of spacetime where they reduce, as boundary conditions, to the folded string solutions that have been known for 19 years.

The special case of the 3-dim oscillator is studied in more detail, because of its relevance in the description of superdeformed nuclei and nuclear and atomic clusters. In this case the symmetry algebra turns out to be a nonlinear extension of the u(3) algebra. A generalized angular momentum operator useful for labeling the degenerate states is constructed, clarifying the connection of the present formalism to the Nilsson model in nuclear physics. '
9411219;'Effect of Self-Interaction on Charged Black Hole Radiance';'Per Kraus and Frank Wilczek';'Tue, 29 Nov 94 11:52:34 EST   (11kb)';'   We extend our previous analysis of the modification of the spectrum of black hole radiance due to the simplest and probably most quantitatively important back-reaction effect, that is self-gravitational interaction, to the case of charged holes. As anticipated, the corrections are small for low-energy radiation when the hole is well away from extremality, butbecome qualitatively important near extremality. A notable result is that radiation which could leave the hole with mass and charge characteristic of a naked singularity, predicted in the usual approximation of fixed space-time geometry, is here suppressed. We discuss the nature of our approximations, and show how they work in a simpler electromagnetic analogue problem. '
9411220;'Chern-Simons and WZNW Theories and the Quark-Gluon Plasma';'V.P.

I review some of the basic properties of hard thermal loops and how the generating functional for them is related to the eikonal for a Chern-Simons gauge theory, and using an auxiliary field, to the gauged Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten action. The Hamiltonian analysis of the effective action and a discussion of plasma waves are given. It is also pointed out that a possible expression for the magnetic mass term can be written in a closely related way. '

The results are applied to the example of ${\cal W}_3$ strings. '
9411222;'The All-Genus String Effective Action';'Rulin Xiu';'Tue, 29 Nov 94 12:52:25 CST   (9kb)';'   We use the off-shell string effective action method developed by E.S. Fradkin and A.A. Tseytlin to obtain the formula for all-genus string effective action with and without compactification at the low-energy approximation in the massless background fields. We find that for the bosonic string, one can determine the dilaton vacuum expectation value from the all-genus effective action because of the nontrivial dependence of potential energy on dilaton. For compactified four-dimensional string models, if one requires that the target-space dilaton field lie on a K\"ahler manifold, we obtain a constraint which will specify the worldsheet dilaton in terms of the constant background fields. We also show that under this constraint, the tree-level k\"ahlar potential and superpotential are not changed by the higher-genus effect. This proves again the non-renormalization theorem for a string moving in massless background fields in the low-energy approximation. '
9411223;'Gauge Field Theories on Riemann Surfaces';'Franco Ferrari';'Tue, 29 Nov 94 19:16:18 +0100   (24kb)';'   In this paper the free gauge field theories on a Riemann surface of any genus are quantized in the covariant gauge.

As an application, the correlation functions of a Yang-Mills field theory with gauge group $SU(N)$ are computed at the lowest order. '
9411224;'Canonical Quantization of the Maxwell-Chern-Simons Theory in the Coulomb';'F. P. Devecchi, M. Fleck, H. O. Girotti (UFRGS-Brasil), M. Gomes and';'Tue, 29 Nov 1994 17:55:10 -0200   (14kb)';'   The Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory is canonically quantized in the Coulomb gauge by using the Dirac bracket quantization procedure. The determination of the Coulomb gauge polarization vector turns out to be intrincate. A set of quantum Poincar\'e densities obeying the Dirac-Schwinger algebra, and, therefore, free of anomalies, is constructed. The peculiar analytical structure of the polarization vector is shown to be at the root for the existence of spin of the massive gauge quanta.The Coulomb gauge Feynman rules are used to compute the M\"oller scattering amplitude in the lowest order of perturbation theory. The result coincides with that obtained by using covariant Feynman rules. This proof of equivalence is, afterwards, extended to all orders of perturbation theory. The so called infrared safe photon propagator emerges as an effective propagator which allows for replacing all the terms in the interaction Hamiltonian of the Coulomb gauge by the standard field-current minimal interaction Hamiltonian.

9411225;'Massive particle creation in a static 1+1 dimensional spacetime';'D.J.Lamb, A.Z.Capri and S.M. Roy';'Tue, 29 Nov 1994 16:39:47 -0700   (10kb)';'   We show explicitly that there is particle creation in a static spacetime. This is done by studying the field in a coordinate system based on a physical principle which has recently been proposed. There the field is quantized by decomposing it into positive and negative frequency modes on a particular spacelike surface. This decomposition depends explicitly on the surface where the decomposition is performed, so that an observer who travels from one surface to another will observe particle production due to the different vacuum state.

9411226;'Critical Temperature and Amplitude Ratios from a Finite-Temperature';'M.A. van Eijck, Denjoe O'Connor and C.R. Stephens';'Wed, 30 Nov 1994 03:05:32 +0000 (GMT)   (13kb)';'   We study $\l\f^4$ theory using an environmentally friendly finite-temperature renormalization group. We derive flow equations, using a fiducial temperature as flow parameter, develop them perturbatively in an expansion free from ultraviolet and infrared divergences, then integrate them numerically from zero to temperatures above the critical temperature. The critical temperature, at which the mass vanishes, is obtained by integrating the flow equations and is determined as a function of the zero-temperature mass and coupling. We calculate the field expectation value and minimum of the effective potential as functions of temperature and derive some universal amplitude ratios which connect the broken and symmetric phases of the theory. The latter are found to be in good agreement with those of the three-dimensional Ising model obtained from high- and low-temperature series expansions. '

We find that the perturbative vacuum with vanishing gauge field strength does not correspond to the minimum of the Euclidean effective action. The true ground state is characterized by a nonvanishing gluon condensate. '
9411228;'Lattice Regularization of Gauge Theories Without Loss of Chiral Symmetry';'G. 't Hooft (Institute for Theoretical Physics, Utrecht University)';'Wed, 30 Nov 1994 16:46:23 +0200   (11kb)';'   A lattice regularization procedure for gauge theories is proposed in which fermions are given a special treatment such that all chiral flavor symmetries that are free of Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomalies are kept intact. There is no doubling of fermionic degrees of freedom. A price paid for this feature is that the number of fermionic degrees of freedom per unit cell is still infinite, although finiteness of the complete functional integrals can be proven (details are outlined in an Appendix). Therefore, although perhaps of limited usefulness for numerical simulations, our scheme can be applied for studying aspects such as analytic convergence questions, spontaneous symmetry breakdown and baryon number violation in non-Abelian gauge theories.

9411229;'The generalized chiral Schwinger model on the two-sphere';'A. Bassetto and L. Griguolo';'Wed, 30 Nov 1994 16:35:54 +0200   (29kb)';'   A family of theories which interpolate between vector and chiral Schwinger models is studied on the two--sphere $S^{2}$. The conflict between the loss of gauge invariance and global geometrical properties is solved by introducing a fixed background connection. In this way the generalized Dirac--Weyl operator can be globally defined on $S^{2}$. The generating functional of the Green functions is obtained by taking carefully into account the contribution of gauge fields with non--trivial topological charge and of the related zero--modes of the Dirac determinant. In the decompactification limit, the Green functions of the flat case are recovered; in particular the fermionic condensate in the vacuum vanishes, at variance with its behaviour in the vector Schwinger model.

9411232;'On Field Theories of Loops';'N. Nakazawa';'Wed, 30 Nov 1994 18:41:46 +0100   (10kb)';'   We apply stochastic quantization method to matrix models for the second quantization of loops in both discretized and continuum levels. The fictitious time evolution described by the Langevin equation is interpreted as the time evolution in a field theory of loops. The corresponding Fokker-Planck hamiltonian defines a non-critical string field theory. We study both orientable and non-orientable interactions of loops in terms of matrix models and take the continuum limit for one-matrix case. As a consequence, we show the equivalence of stochastic quantization of matrix models in loop space to the transfer-matrix formalism in dynamical triangulation of random surfaces. We also clarifies the origin of Virasoro algebra in this context. '
9411234;'Arithmetic Properties of Mirror Map and Quantum Coupling';'Bong H. Lian and Shing-Tung Yau';'Wed, 30 Nov 94 13:27:45 EST   (30kb)';'   We study some arithmetic properties of the mirror maps and the quantum Yukawa coupling for some 1-parameter deformations of Calabi-Yau manifolds. First we use the Schwarzian differential equation, which we derived previously, to characterize the mirror map in each case. For algebraic K3 surfaces, we solve the equation in terms of the $J$-function. By deriving explicit modular relations we prove that some K3 mirror maps are algebraic over the genus zero function field ${\bf Q}(J)$. This leads to a uniform proof that those mirror maps have integral Fourier coefficients. Regarding the maps as Riemann mappings, we prove that they are genus zero functions. By virtue of the Conway-Norton conjecture (proved by Borcherds using Frenkel-Lepowsky-Meurman's Moonshine module), we find that these maps are actually the reciprocals of the Thompson series for certain conjugacy classes in the Griess-Fischer group. This also gives, as an immediate consequence, a second proof that those mirror maps are integral. We thus conjecture a surprising connection between K3 mirror maps and the Thompson series. For threefolds, we construct a formal nonlinear ODE for the quantum coupling reduced $mod\ p$. Under the mirror hypothesis and an integrality assumption, we derive $mod~p$ congruences for the Fourier coefficients. For the quintics, we deduce (at least for $5\not{|}d$) that the degree $d$ instanton numbers $n_d$ are divisible by $5^3$ -- a fact first conjectured by Clemens. '

9411237;'Discrete spectral shift in an anisotropic universe';'D.J.Lamb, A.Z.Capri and M. Kobayashi';'Wed, 30 Nov 1994 11:34:34 -0700   (7kb)';'   In this paper we calculate the particle creation as seen by a stationary observer in an anisotropic universe. By using an observer and geometry dependent time to quantise a massive scalar field we show that a discrete energy spectrum shift occurs. The length scale associated with the geometry provides the energy scale by which the spectrum is shifted. The $\beta(p,q)$ coefficient for the Bogolubov transformation calculated is proportional to a series of delta functions whose argument contains $p$ and $q$ and half multiples of the root of the curvature.

9411238;'The $\zeta$-function answer to parity violation in three dimensional';'R.E.Gamboa Saravi, G.L.Rossini and F.A.Schaposnik';'Wed, 30 Nov 94 17:01:41-030   (17kb)';'   We study parity violation in $2+1$-dimensional gauge theories coupled to massive fermions. Using the $\zeta$-function regularization approach we evaluate the ground state fermion current in an arbitrary gauge field background, showing that it gets two different contributions which violate parity invariance and induce a Chern-Simons term in the gauge-field effective action. One is related to the well-known {\em classical} parity breaking produced by a fermion mass term in 3 dimensions; the other one, already present for massless fermions, is related to peculiarities of gauge invariant regularization in odd-dimensional spaces.

9411239;'Dynamical Chiral Symmetry Breaking, Goldstone's Theorem and the';'H.J. Munczek';'Wed, 30 Nov 1994 14:33 CST   (9kb)';'   A proof of Goldstone's theorem is given for the case in which global chiral symmetry is dynamically broken. The proof highlights a needed consistency between the exact Schwinger--Dyson equation for the fermion propagator and the exact Bethe--Salpeter equation for fermion--antifermion bound states. A criterion, based on the Cornwall, Jackiw and Tomboulis effective action for composite operators, is provided for maintaining the consistency when the equations are modified by approximations. For gauge theories in which partial conservation of the axial current (PCAC) should hold, a constraint on the approximations to the fermion--gauge boson vertex function is discussed, and a vertex model is given which satisfies both the PCAC constraint and the vector Ward--Takahashi identity.

We apply the recently developed technique to construct new solutions to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation associated with the one-parameter family of irreps of $U_q(gl(m|n))$, thus obtaining R-matrices which depend not only on a spectral parameter but in addition on further continuous parameters. These extra parameters enter the Yang-Baxter equation in a similar way to the spectral parameter but in a non-additive form. '
9411242;'On Conformal Properties of the Dualized Sigma-Models';'Eugene Tyurin';'Wed, 30 Nov 94 22:36 EST   (11kb)';'   We have calculated the first-order beta-functions for a sigma-model ( with dilaton) dualized with respect to an arbitrary Lie group that acts without isotropy. We find that non-abelian duality preserves conformal invariance for semi-simple groups, but in general there is an extra contribution to the beta-function proportional to the trace of the structure constants, which cannot be absorbed into an additional dilaton shift. Two particular examples, a Bianchi V cosmological background and the G \otimes G WZW model, are discussed. '

A Floer derivative and a Morse functional are found and are used to construct a unitary transformation between the usual Floer cohomologies and those of the monopole equations. Furthermore, these equations are seen to reside in the vanishing self-dual curvature condition of an $OSp(1|2)$-bundle. Alternatively, they may be seen arising directly from a vanishing self-dual curvature condition on an $SU(2)$-bundle in which the fermions are realized as spanning the tangent space for a specific background.

Specifically, starting from the massive, moduli-dependent string spectrum after compactification, we derive the threshold functions as target space duality invariant free energies (sum over massive string states). In particular we work out the dependence on the continuous Wilson line moduli fields. In addition we concentrate on the physically interesting effect that at certain critical points in the orbifold moduli spaces additional massless states appear in the string spectrum leading to logarithmic singularities in the threshold functions. We discuss this effect for the gauge coupling threshold corrections; here the appearance of additional massless states is directly related to the Higgs effect in string theory. In addition the singularities in the threshold functions are relevant for the loop corrections to the gravitational coupling constants. '

It is shown that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $S^{BH}$ (defined by the response of the free energy of a system containing a black hole on the change of the temperature) differs from the statistical- mechanical entropy $S^{SM}=-\mbox{Tr}(\hat{\rho}\ln \hat{\rho})$ (defined by counting internal degrees of freedom of a black hole). A simple explanation of the universality of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy (i.e. its independence of the number and properties of the fields which might contribute to $S^{SM}$) is given. '

It consists of string interaction vertices similar to the light-cone gauge string field theory. A slight modification of the definition of the time coordinate is needed because of the existence of the open string end points. '

We exactly calculate the free energy and the correlation functions which allow us to obtain the critical diffusion constant and associated critical exponents. It is pointed out that these critical exponents do not satisfy the hyper-scaling relation but the scaling inequalities. We take the continuum limit of this theory on the basis of these analyses. We check the universality of obtained results on other lattice structure such as triclinic lattice and body centered lattice. '

The difference is established in comparison with the Gates-Nishino lagrangian at the fourth order level in fermionic fields. '
9412218;'Operator Ordering Problem of the Nonrelativistic Chern-Simons Theory';'Mu-In Park and Young-Jai Park';'Tue, 27 Dec 1994 02:06:14 +0900 (KST)   (12kb)';'   The operator ordering problem due to the quantization or regularization ambiguity in the Chern-Simons theory exists. However, we show that this can be avoided if we require Galilei covariance of the nonrelativistic Abelian Chern-Simons theory even at the quantum level for the extended sources. The covariance can be recovered only by choosing some particular operator orderings for the generators of the Galilei group depending on the quantization ambiguities of the $gauge-matter$ commutation relation. We show that the desired ordering for the unusual prescription is not the same as the well-known normal ordering but still satisfies all the necessary conditions. Furthermore, we show that the equations of motion can be expressed in a similar form regardless of the regularization ambiguity. This suggests that the different regularization prescriptions do not change the physics. On the other hand, for the case of point sources the regularization prescription is uniquely determined, and only the orderings, which are equivalent to the usual one, are allowed. '
9412219;'Differential Equations Associated to The SU(2) WZNW Model on Elliptic';'Takeshi Suzuki';'Tue, 27 Dec 94 04:26:16 JST   (18kb)';'   We study the $SU(2)$ WZNW model over a family of elliptic curves. Starting from the formulation developed by Tsuchiya, Ueno and Yamada, we derive a system of differential equations which contains the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equations. Our system completely determines the $N$-point functions and it is regarded as a natural elliptic analogue of the one developed by Tsuchiya and Kanie for the projective line. We also calculate the system for the 1-point functions explicitly. This gives a generalization of the system for $\hat\frak{sl}(2,\C)$-characters derived by Eguchi and Ooguri. '

By setting up a generalised vielbein, we study the metric structure. Metric compatible torsion free connection defines a unique finite field content in the model and leads to a discretized version of Kaluza-Klein theory. We study some special cases of this model that illustrate the rich and complex structure with massive modes and the possible presence of a cosmological constant. '

Certain integrability obstructions are observed that constrain the most general constructions containing both matter and twisted matter simultaneously. It is conjectured that knot invariants will ultimately play a role in describing the most general such model. '
9412224;'On Quantum Black Holes';'Yoichi Kazama';'Wed, 28 Dec 94 14:43:40 +0900   (102kb)';'   A pedagogical discussion is given of some aspects of \lq\lq quantum black holes", primarily using recently developed two-dimensional models. After a short preliminary concerning classical black holes, we give several motivations for studying such models, especially the so called dilaton gravity models in $1+1$ dimensions. Particularly attractive is the one proposed by Callan,Giddings, Harvey and Strominger (CGHS), which is classically solvable and contains black hole solutions. Its semi-classical as well as classical properties will be reviewed, including how a flux of matter fields produces a black hole with a subsequent emission of Hawking radiation. Breakdown of such an approximation near the horizon, however, calls for exactly solvable variants of this model and some attempts in this direction will then be described. A focus will be placed on a model with 24 matter fields, for which exact quantization can be performed and physical states constructed. A method will then be proposed to extract space-time geometry described by these states in the sense of quantum average and examples containing a black hole will be presented. Finally we give a (partial) list of future problems and discuss the nature of difficulties in resolving them. '

9412227;'Modification of Matrix Models by Square Terms of Scaling Operators';'Hiroshi Shirokura (Osaka University)';'Wed, 28 Dec 94 20:54:28 +0900   (20kb)';'   We study one (or two) matrix models modified by terms of the form $g(\rho(P))^2 + g'(\rho'({\cal{O}}))^2$, where the matrix representation of the puncture operator $P$ and the one of a scaling operator ${\cal{O}}$ are denoted by $\rho(P)$ and $\rho'({\cal{O}})$ respectively. We rewrite the modified models as effective theories of baby universes. We find an upper bound for the gravitational dimension of ${\cal{O}}$ under which we can fine tune the coupling constants to obtain new critical behaviors in the continuum limit. The simultaneous tuning of $g$ and $g'$ is possible if the representations $\rho(P)$ and $\rho'({\cal{O}})$ are chosen so that the non-diagonal elements of the mass matrix of the effective theory vanish.

Zamolodchikov';'Wed, 28 Dec 94 18:19:42 EST   (20kb)';'   We construct the quantum versions of the monodromy matrices of KdV theory. The traces of these quantum monodromy matrices, which will be called as ``${\bf T}$-operators'', act in highest weight Virasoro modules. The ${\bf T}$-operators depend on the spectral parameter $\lambda$ and their expansion around $\lambda = \infty$ generates an infinite set of commuting Hamiltonians of the quantum KdV system. The ${\bf T}$-operators can be viewed as the continuous field theory versions of the commuting transfer-matrices of integrable lattice theory. In particular, we show that for the values $c=1-3{{(2n+1)^2}\over {2n+3}} , n=1,2,3,... $of the Virasoro central charge the eigenvalues of the ${\bf T}$-operators satisfy a closed system of functional equations sufficient for determining the spectrum. For the ground-state eigenvalue these functional equations are equivalent to those of massless Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz for the minimal conformal field theory ${\cal M}_{2,2n+3}$; in general they provide a way to generalize the technique of Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz to the excited states. We discuss a generalization of our approach to the cases of massive field theories obtained by perturbing these Conformal Field Theories with the operator $\Phi_{1,3}$. The relation of these ${\bf T}$-operators to the boundary states is also briefly described. '
9412230;'Universal correlations for deterministic plus random Hamiltonians';'E. Brezin, S. Hikami and A.Zee';'Thu, 29 Dec 94 18:25:16 JST   (15kb)';'   We consider the (smoothed) average correlation between the density of energy levels of a disordered system, in which the Hamiltonian is equal to the sum of a deterministic H0 and of a random potential $\varphi$. Remarkably, this correlation function may be explicitly determined in the limit of large matrices, for any unperturbed H0 and for a class of probability distribution P$(\varphi)$ of the random potential. We find a compact representation of the correlation function. From this representation one obtains readily the short distance behavior, which has been conjectured in various contexts to be universal. Indeed we find that it is totally independent of both H0 and P($\varphi$). '

Different arguments leading to this conclusion are considered, particularly the decoupling between left and right sectors in string theory - the so-called heterotic principle. The case of a $2+1$ dimensional black holes is considered as an argument in favour of this argument. The possible connection between membrane model of the black hole horizon and topological membrane is briefly discussed. '

9412236;'Summing the Instantons: Quantum Cohomology and Mirror Symmetry in Toric';'David R. Morrison and M. Ronen Plesser';'Thu, 29 Dec 94 22:31:09 EST   (86kb)';'   We use the gauged linear sigma model introduced by Witten to calculate instanton expansions for correlation functions in topological sigma models with target space a toric variety $V$ or a Calabi--Yau hypersurface $M \subset V$. In the linear model the instanton moduli spaces are relatively simple objects and the correlators are explicitly computable; moreover, the instantons can be summed, leading to explicit solutions for both kinds of models. In the case of smooth $V$, our results reproduce and clarify an algebraic solution of the $V$ model due to Batyrev. In addition, we find an algebraic relation determining the solution for $M$ in terms of that for $V$. Finally, we propose a modification of the linear model which computes instanton expansions about any limiting point in the moduli space. In the smooth case this leads to a (second) algebraic solution of the $M$ model. We use this description to prove some conjectures about mirror symmetry, including the previously conjectured ``monomial-divisor mirror map'' of Aspinwall, Greene, and Morrison. '
9412237;'Generalized Quantum Inverse Scattering';'C. Schwiebert';'Fri, 30 Dec 94 19:52:56 JST   (11kb)';'   A generalization of the quantum inverse scattering method is proposed replacing the quantum group $RLL$ commutation relations of Lax operators by reflection equation type $RLRL$ commutation relations. Under some natural assumptions the most general algebra of this type allowing to construct the neccessary integrals of motion is found. It serves to describe Lax operators with completely non-ultralocal commutation relations. An example of this new formalism is an integrable model on monodromies of flat connections on a Riemann surface which is related to the XXZ quantum spin chain. '
9412239;'Light-Front Dynamics of Chern-Simons Systems';'Prem P.

It is shown that no inconsistency arises on using two local gauge-fixing conditions in the Dirac procedure. The light-front Hamiltonian turns out to be simple and the framework may be useful to construct renormalized field theory of particles with fractional statistics ({\it anyons}). The theory is shown to be relativistic and the extra term in the transformation of the matter field under space rotations, interpreted in previous works as anomaly, is argued to be gauge artefact. '

Renormalization of the two dimensional $\phi^{4}$ theory, described in the continuum, is discussed. The mass renormalization condition and the renormalized constraint equation contain all the information to describe the phase transition in the theory, which is found to be of the second order. We argue that the same result would also be obtained in the conventional equal-time formulation. '

9412242;'From N=2 Fermionic Strings to Superstrings?';'Olaf Lechtenfeld';'Sat, 31 Dec 1994 04:01:21 +0100   (19kb)';'   I review the covariant quantization of the critical $N{=}2$ fermionic string with and without a global ${\bf Z}_2$ twist. The BRST analysis yields massless bosonic and fermionic vertex operators in various ghost and picture number sectors, as well as picture-changers and their inverses, depending on the field basis chosen for bosonization. Two distinct GSO projections exist, one (untwisted) retaining merely the known bosonic scalar and its spectral-flow partner, the other (twisted) yielding two fermions and one boson, on the massless level. The absence of interactions in the latter case rules out standard spacetime supersymmetry. In the untwisted theory, the $U(1,1)$-invariant three-point and vanishing four-point functions are confirmed at tree level. I comment on the $N{=}2$ string field theory, the integration over moduli and the realization of spectral flow. '

We show as the initial symmetries are transformed in the transition from $L$ to first order action, and then to the Hamiltonian action $S_H=\int{\rm d}\tau(p_A\dot q^A-H_0-v^\alpha\Phi_\alpha)$, where $\Phi_\alpha$ are the all (first and second class) primary constraints. An exact formulae for local symmetries of $S_H$ in terms of the initial generators ${R_a}^A$ and all primary constraints $\Phi_\alpha$ are obtained. '

We also point out an interesting duality relation - Poincar\'e duality - with respect to gauge anomalies and Wess-Zumino-Witten topological terms. We consider the consistent embedding of the BRST adjoint generator $Q^{\dagger}$ into the relativistic phase space and identify the noncovariant symmetry recently discovered in QED with the BRST adjoint N\"other charge $Q^{\dagger}$.

Morrison (with an appendix by Mark';'Wed, 29 Mar 95 12:52:48 EST   (31kb)';'   We study a topological obstruction of a very stringy nature concerned with deforming the target space of an $N=2$ non-linear \sm. This target space has a singularity which may be smoothed away according to the conventional rules of geometry but when one studies the associated conformal field theory one sees that such a deformation is not possible without a discontinuous change in some of the correlation functions. This obstruction appears to come from torsion in the homology of the target space (which is seen by deforming the theory by an irrelevant operator). We discuss the link between this phenomenon and orbifolds with discrete torsion as studied by Vafa and Witten. '
9503209;'ON GRAVITATIONAL DRESSING OF 2D FIELD THEORIES IN CHIRAL GAUGE';'Adel Bilal and Ian. I. Kogan';'Wed, 29 Mar 1995 21:50:38 +0200   (17kb)';'   After giving a pedagogical review of the chiral gauge approach to 2D gravity, with particular emphasis on the derivation of the gravitational Ward identities, we discuss in some detail the interpretation of matter correlation functions coupled to gravity in chiral gauge. We argue that in chiral gauge no {\it explicit} gravitational dressing factor, analogue to the Liouville exponential in conformal gauge, is necessary for left-right symmetric matter operators. In particular, we examine the gravitationally dressed four-point correlation function of products of left and right fermions. We solve the corresponding gravitational Ward identity exactly: in the presence of gravity this four-point function exhibits a logarithmic short-distance singularity, instead of the power-law singularity in the absence of gravity. This rather surprising effect is non-perturbative in the gravitational coupling and is a sign for logarithms in the gravitationally dressed operator product expansions. We also discuss some perturbative evidence that the chiral Gross-Neveu model may remain integrable when coupled to gravity. '
9503210;'BRST properties of spin fields';'L. Dolan and S. Horvath ';'Wed, 29 Mar 95 15:42:46 EST   (22kb)';'   For the closed superstring, spin fields and bi-spinor states are defined directly in four spacetime dimensions. Explicit operator product expansions are given, including those for the internal superconformal field theory, which are consistent with locality and BRST invariance for the string vertices. The most general BRST picture changing for these fields is computed. A covariant notation for the spin decomposition of these states is developed in which non-vanishing polarizations are selected automatically. The kinematics of the three-gluon dual model amplitude in both the Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond sectors in the Lorentz gauges is calculated and contrasted. Modular invariance and enhanced gauge symmetry of four-dimensional models incorporating these states is described. '
9503211;'Integrable Lax Hierarchies, their Symmetry Reductions and Multi-Matrix';'H. Aratyn';'Wed, 29 Mar 1995 17:37:45 -0500 (CDT)   (42kb)';'   Some new developments in constrained Lax integrable systems and their applications to physics are reviewed. After summarizing the tau function construction of the KP hierarchy and the basic concepts of the symmetry of nonlinear equations, more recent ideas dealing with constrained KP models are described. A unifying approach to constrained KP hierarchy based on graded $SL(r+n,n)$ algebra is presented and equivalence formulas are obtained for various pseudo-differential Lax operators appearing in this context. It is then shown how the Toda lattice structure emerges from constrained KP models via canonical Darboux-B\"{a}cklund transformations. These transformations enable us to find simple Wronskian solutions for the underlying tau-functions. We also establish a relation between two-matrix models and constrained Toda lattice systems and derive from this relation expressions for the corresponding partition function. '
9503212;'Criteria for Conformal Invariance of (0,2) Models';'Eva Silverstein and Edward Witten';'Thu, 30 Mar 1995 03:53:58 GMT   (33kb)';'   It is argued that many linear (0,2) models flow in the infrared to conformally invariant solutions of string theory. The strategy in the argument is to show that the effective space-time superpotential must vanish because there is no place where it can have a pole. This conclusion comes from either of two different analyses, in which the Kahler class or the complex structure of the gauge bundle is varied, while keeping everything else fixed. In the former case, we recover from the linear sigma model the usual simple pole in the ${\bf \bar {27}}^3$ Yukawa coupling but show that an analogous pole does not arise in the couplings of gauge singlet modes. In the latter case, a dimension count shows that the world-sheet instanton sum does not ``see'' the singularities of the gauge bundle and hence cannot have a pole. '

In four and higher dimensions this spin system can be described in terms of a two-plaquette gauge Hamiltonian. The duality transformation is constructed in geometrical and algebraic language. The dual Hamiltonian represents a new type of spin system with local gauge invariance. At each vertex $\xi$ there are $d(d-1)/2$ Ising spins $\Lambda_{\mu,\nu}= \Lambda_{\nu,\mu}$, $\mu \neq \nu = 1,..,d$ and one Ising spin $\Gamma$ on every link $(\xi,\xi +e_{\mu})$. For the frozen spin $\Gamma \equiv 1$ the dual Hamiltonian factorizes into $d(d-1)/2$ two-dimensional Ising ferromagnets and into antiferromagnets in the case $\Gamma \equiv -1$. For fluctuating $\Gamma$ it is a sort of spin glass system with local gauge invariance. The generalization to $p$-branes is given. '

From the phase space analysis, we find that the inflationary phase does not smoothly connect to a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) expanding universe, thereby providing a simple tachyonic extension of the recently proved stringy no-go theorem.

9503217;'Extensions of the matrix Gelfand-Dickey hierarchy from generalized';'Laszlo Feher and Ian Marshall';'Thu, 30 Mar 95 12:58:57 +0100   (50kb)';'   The $p\times p$ matrix version of the $r$-KdV hierarchy has been recently treated as the reduced system arising in a Drinfeld-Sokolov type Hamiltonian symmetry reduction applied to a Poisson submanifold in the dual of the Lie algebra $\widehat{gl}_{pr}\otimes {\Complex}[\lambda, \lambda^{-1}]$. Here a series of extensions of this matrix Gelfand-Dickey system is derived by means of a generalized Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction defined for the Lie algebra $\widehat{gl}_{pr+s}\otimes {\Complex}[\lambda,\lambda^{-1}]$ using the natural embedding $gl_{pr}\subset gl_{pr+s}$ for $s$ any positive integer. The hierarchies obtained admit a description in terms of a $p\times p$ matrix pseudo-differential operator comprising an $r$-KdV type positive part and a non-trivial negative part. This system has been investigated previously in the $p=1$ case as a constrained KP system. In this paper the previous results are considerably extended and a systematic study is presented on the basis of the Drinfeld-Sokolov approach that has the advantage that it leads to local Poisson brackets and makes clear the conformal ($\cal W$-algebra) structures related to the KdV type hierarchies. Discrete reductions and modified versions of the extended $r$-KdV hierarchies are also discussed. '

9503220;'General Correlation Functions in the Schwinger Model at Zero and Finite';'James V.

The zero temperature calculations on the plane are reviewed and clarified. Then the finite temperature fermionic Green's function is computed and the results on the torus are compared to those on the plane. It is concluded that a simpler way to calculate the finite temperature results is to associate certain terms in the zero temperature structure with their finite temperature counterparts. '

It is argued that these theories with matter couplings can be made nontrivial by means of the reduction of couplings, leading to the idea of dynamical unification of couplings (DUC) The second-order reduction of couplings in the ANF $SU(3)$-gauged Higgs-Yukawa theory, which is assumed to be nontrivial here, is carried out to motivate independent investigations on its nontriviality and DUC.

When the pressures in all spaces are proportional to the density, the Einstein and Wheeler-DeWitt equations are integrated for a large variety of parameters. Classical and quantum wormhole solutions are obtained for negative density. Some special classes of solutions, e.g. solutions with spontaneous and dynamical compactification, exponential and power-law inflations, are singled out. For positive density a third quantized cosmological model is considered and the Planckian spectrum of created universes is obtained. '

9503225;'Non-Compact Pure Gauge QED in 3D is Free';'Tim R. Morris';'Fri, 31 Mar 95 20:02:59 BST   (13kb)';'   For all Poincar\'e invariant Lagrangians of the form ${\cal L}\equiv f(F_{\mu\nu})$, in three Euclidean dimensions, where $f$ is any invariant function of a non-compact $U(1)$ field strength $F_{\mu\nu}$, we find that the only continuum limit (described by just such a gauge field) is that of free field theory: First we approximate a gauge invariant version of Wilson's renormalization group by neglecting all higher derivative terms $\sim \partial^nF$ in ${\cal L}$, but allowing for a general non-vanishing anomalous dimension. Then we prove analytically that the resulting flow equation has only one acceptable fixed point: the Gaussian fixed point. The possible relevance to high-$T_c$ superconductivity is briefly discussed.

9503226;'Target Space Duality between Simple Compact Lie Groups and Lie Algebras';'Orlando Alvarez and Chien-Hao Liu';'Fri, 31 Mar 95 16:35:45 EDT   (51kb)';'   It has been suggested that a possible classical remnant of the phenomenon of target-space duality (T-duality) would be the equivalence of the classical string Hamiltonian systems. Given a simple compact Lie group $G$ with a bi-invariant metric and a generating function $\Gamma$ suggested in the physics literature, we follow the above line of thought and work out the canonical transformation $\Phi$ generated by $\Gamma$ together with an $\Ad$-invariant metric and a B-field on the associated Lie algebra $\frak g$ of $G$ so that $G$ and $\frak g$ form a string target-space dual pair at the classical level under the Hamiltonian formalism. In this article, some general features of this Hamiltonian setting are discussed. We study properties of the canonical transformation $\Phi$ including a careful analysis of its domain and image. The geometry of the T-dual structure on $\frak g$ is lightly touched. '
9503227;'Boundary energy and boundary states in integrable quantum field theories';'A. LeClair, G. Mussardo, H. Saleur, S. Skorik';'Fri, 31 Mar 1995 15:11:13 -0800   (36kb)';'   We study the ground state energy of integrable $1+1$ quantum field theories with boundaries (the genuine Casimir effect). In the scalar case, this is done by introducing a new, ``R-channel TBA'', where the boundary is represented by a boundary state, and the thermodynamics involves evaluating scalar products of boundary states with all the states of the theory. In the non-scalar, sine-Gordon case, this is done by generalizing the method of Destri and De Vega. The two approaches are compared. Miscellaneous other results are obtained, in particular formulas for the overall normalization and scalar products of boundary states, exact partition functions for the critical Ising model in a boundary magnetic field, and also results for the energy, excited states and boundary S-matrix of $O(n)$ and minimal models.

9503228;'STRINGY EVIDENCE FOR D=11 STRUCTURE IN STRONGLY COUPLED TYPE II-A';'Itzhak Bars';'Fri, 31 Mar 1995 22:05:58 -0800   (16kb)';'   Witten proposed that the low energy physics of strongly coupled D=10 type-IIA superstring may be described by D=11 supergravity. To explore the stringy aspects of the underlying theory we examine the stringy massive states. We propose a systematic formula for identifying non-perturbative states in D=10 type-IIA superstring theory, such that, together with the elementary excited string states, they form D=11 supersymmetric multiplets multiplets in SO(10) representations. This provides hints for the construction of a weakly coupled D=11 theory that is dual to the strongly coupled D=10 type IIA superstring. '
9503229;'The $W_{1 + \infty }$ effective theory of the Calogero- Sutherland model';'R. Caracciolo, A. Lerda, G. R.

It is given by a $\winf$ conformal field theory (with central charge $c=1$) that describes {\it exactly} the spatial density fluctuations arising from the low-energy excitations about the Fermi surface. Our approach does not rely on the integrable character of the model, and indicates how to extend previous results to any order in powers of $1/N$. Moreover, the same effective theory can also be used to describe an entire universality class of $(1+1)$-dimensional fermionic systems beyond the Calogero-Sutherland model, that we identify with the class of {\it chiral Luttinger systems}. We also explain how a systematic bosonization procedure can be performed using the $\winf$ generators, and propose this algebraic approach to {\it classify} low-dimensional non-relativistic fermionic systems, given that all representations of $\winf$ are known. This approach has the appeal of being mathematically complete and physically intuitive, encoding the picture suggested by Luttinger's theorem. '

9503231;'Modular Invariance and the Finiteness of Superstring Theory';'Simon Davis';'Sat, 1 Apr 95 12:00 BST   (28kb)';'   The genus-dependence of multi-loop superstring amplitudes is bounded at large orders in perturbation theory using the super-Schottky group parametrization of supermoduli space. Partial estimates of supermoduli space integrals suggest an exponential dependence on the genus when the integration region is restricted to a single fundamental domain of the super-modular group in the super-Schottky parameter space. Bounds for N-point superstring scattering amplitudes are obtained for arbitrary N and are shown to be consistent with exact results recently obtained for special type II string amplitudes for orbifold or Calabi-Yau compactifications. It is suggested that the generic estimates, which imply the validity of superstring perturbation theory in the weak-coupling limit, might be used to determine scattering amplitudes at strong coupling because of the S-duality of type II and heterotic string theories. Non-perturbative effects are consistent with these estimates, based on a sum over closed surfaces, because they can be derived from an additional contribution to the sum over surfaces corresponding to the insertion of Dirichlet boundaries.

Motivated by the example of dimensional-regularization we define the dimension of a space as the trace of a diagonal `unit operator', where the diagonal matrix elements are not, in general, unity but are probabilities to place the system into a given state. These probabilities are uniquely defined by the rules of Haldane's statistics. We calculate the second virial coefficient for our system and demonstrate agreement with Murthy and Shankar's calculation. The partition function for an ideal gas of the particles, a state-counting procedure, the entropy and a distribution function for the particles are investigated using our probabilistic definition. We compare our results with previous calculations of exclusion statistics. '

By explicitly constructing the many-body Hilbert space, we obtain a new algebra of operators and a new thermodynamics. The new statistics is different from fractional exclusion statistics; and in a certain limit, it reduces to the case of parafermi statistics. '

Kehagias';'Fri, 30 Jun 1995 17:12:54 +0200   (10kb)';'   We examine 4-dimensional string backgrounds compactified over a two torus. There exist two alternative effective Lagrangians containing each two $SL(2)/U(1)$ sigma-models. Two of these sigma-models are the complex and the K\"ahler structures on the torus. The effective Lagrangians are invariant under two different $O(2,2)$ groups and by the successive applications of these groups the affine $\widehat{O}(2,2)$ Kac-Moody is emerged. The latter has also a non-zero central term which generates constant Weyl rescalings of the reduced 2-dimensional background. In addition, there exists a number of discrete symmetries relating the field content of the reduced effective Lagrangians. '
9506206;'Two-dimensional Quantum-Corrected Eternal Black Hole';'Sergey N. Solodukhin';'Fri, 30 Jun 1995 19:41:11 -0300   (21kb)';'   The one-loop quantum corrections to geometry and thermodynamics of black hole are studied for the two-dimensional RST model. We chose boundary conditions corresponding to the eternal black hole being in the thermal equilibrium with the Hawking radiation. The equations of motion are exactly integrated. The one of the solutions obtained is the constant curvature space-time with dilaton being a constant function. Such a solution is absent in the classical theory. On the other hand, we derive the quantum-corrected metric (\ref{solution}) written in the Schwarzschild like form which is a deformation of the classical black hole solution \cite{5d}. The space-time singularity occurs to be milder than in classics and the solution admits two asymptotically flat black hole space-times lying at "different sides" of the singularity. The thermodynamics of the classical black hole and its quantum counterpart is formulated. The thermodynamical quantities (energy, temperature, entropy) are calculated and occur to be the same for both the classical and quantum-corrected black holes. So, no quantum corrections to thermodynamics are observed. The possible relevance of the results obtained to the four-dimensional case is discussed. '

Starting from the chiral algebra $\cA$ of a string background, we consider a number of elementary but universal operations on the chiral algebra. From these operations we deduce a certain fundamental odd Poisson structure, known as a Gerstenhaber algebra, on the BRST cohomology of $\cA$. For the 2D string background, the correponding G-algebra can be partially described in term of a geometrical G-algebra of the affine plane $\bC^2$.

While at zero temperature the charge is known to be proportional to a CP violating $\theta$ parameter, we find that at high temperature the charge is proportional to sin $\theta$. Other features of the charge at nonzero temperature are discussed. We also compute the induced charge at nonzero temperature around an Aharonov-Bohm flux string in $2+1$ dimensions and compare the result with an index theorem, and also with the electron-monopole problem in $3+1$ dimensions.

The algebras among the generators and the fields make concrete and clear the bi-module properties of the $\tilde g$ and the $\tilde g^{-1}$ fields. We show that the correlation functions of the $\tilde g$ and $\tilde g^{-1}$ fields in the vacuum state defined through the semi-local quantum-group generator satisfy a set of quantum-group difference equations. We give the explicit solution for the two point function. A similar formulation can also be done for the quantum Self-dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) theory in four dimensions. '

The former corresponds to electrovac solutions whereas the later solutions are identified as gravitational instanton solutions for Fubini-Study metric. The symmetries of the effective actions are identified and new classical solutions are generated by implementing appropriate noncompact transformations. The S-duality transformations on the equations of motion are discussed and it is found that they are S-duality noninvariant due to the presence of cosmological constant term. '

Egusquiza';'Sun, 2 Jul 1995 17:41:30 +0200   (16kb)';'   The string equations of motion and constraints are solved near the horizon and near the singularity of a Schwarzschild black hole. In a conformal gauge such that $\tau = 0$ ($\tau$ = worldsheet time coordinate) corresponds to the horizon ($r=1$) or to the black hole singularity ($r=0$), the string coordinates express in power series in $\tau$ near the horizon and in power series in $\tau^{1/5}$ around $r=0$. We compute the string invariant size and the string energy-momentum tensor. Near the horizon both are finite and analytic. Near the black hole singularity, the string size, the string energy and the transverse pressures (in the angular directions) tend to infinity as $r^{-1}$. To leading order near $r=0$, the string behaves as two dimensional radiation. This two spatial dimensions are describing the $S^2$ sphere in the Schwarzschild manifold. '

We present new unified expressions for the generating operators which are more invariant and which yield a natural realization of the operator V^a and provide for a geometrical explanation for its presence. This V^a operator provides then for an invariant definition of a degenerate Poisson bracket on the triplectic manifold being nondegenerate on a naturally defined submanifold. We also define inverses to nondegenerate antitriplectic metrics and give a natural generalization of the conventional calculus of exterior differential forms which e g explains the properties of these inverses. Finally we define and give a consistent treatment of second class hyperconstraints. '
9510202;'Cosmic p-branes';'Ruth Gregory';'Fri, 27 Oct 95 17:44:32 BST   (20kb)';'   We consider the metrics for cosmic strings and $p$-branes in spacetime dimension $N>4$, that is, we look for solutions to Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton gravity in $N$-dimensions with boost symmetry in the $p$-directions along the brane. Focussing first in detail on the five dimensional uncharged cosmic string we discuss the solution, which turns out to have a naked singularity on the brane, as well as considering its Kaluza-Klein reduction. We show how singularities may be avoided with particular core models. We then derive the general uncharged $p$-brane solution in arbitrary dimension. Finally, we consider an Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton action, with arbitrary value of the dilaton coupling parameter, deriving the solutions for electrically and magnetically charged branes, as well as a class of self-dual branes.

We show that going over to a different basis of curvature invariants makes possible a partial summation of this expansion. Only the form factors of the Weyl-tensor invariants need be calculated. The full action is then uniquely recovered to all orders from the knowledge of the trace anomaly. We present an explicit expression for the partially summed action, and point out simplifications resulting in the vertex functions. An application to the effect of the vacuum gravitational waves is discussed. '

9510208;'Spin/disorder correlations and duality in the c=1/2 string';'Sean M. Carroll, Miguel E. Ortiz and Washington Taylor IV';'Sat, 28 Oct 1995 20:02:09 -0400   (17kb)';'   We use the method of discrete loop equations to calculate exact correlation functions of spin and disorder operators on the sphere and on the boundary of a disk in the $c = 1/2$ string, both in the Ising and dual Ising matrix model formulations. For both the Ising and dual Ising theories the results on the sphere are in agreement with the KPZ/DDK scaling predictions based on Liouville theory; the results on the disk agree with the scaling predictions of Martinec, Moore, and Seiberg for boundary operators. The calculation of Ising disorder correlations on the sphere requires the use of boundary variables introduced in [hep-th/9510199], which have no matrix model analog. A subtlety in the calculation on the disk arises because the expansions of the correlation functions have leading singular terms which are nonuniversal; we show that this issue may be resolved by using separate cosmological constants for each boundary domain. These results give evidence that the Kramers-Wannier duality symmetry of the $c = 1/2$ conformal field theory survives coupling to quantum gravity, implying a duality symmetry of the $c = 1/2$ string even in the presence of boundary operators.

9510209;'Heterotic and Type I String Dynamics from Eleven Dimensions';'Petr Horava and Edward Witten';'Sun, 29 Oct 1995 22:08:49 GMT   (20kb)';'   We propose that the ten-dimensional $E_8\times E_8$ heterotic string is related to an eleven-dimensional theory on the orbifold ${\bf R}^{10}\times {\bf S}^1/{\bf Z}_2$ in the same way that the Type IIA string in ten dimensions is related to ${\bf R}^{10}\times {\bf S}^1$. This in particular determines the strong coupling behavior of the ten-dimensional $E_8\times E_8$ theory. It also leads to a plausible scenario whereby duality between $SO(32)$ heterotic and Type I superstrings follows from the classical symmetries of the eleven-dimensional world, just as the $SL(2,{\bf Z})$ duality of the ten-dimensional Type IIB theory follows from eleven-dimensional diffeomorphism invariance.

9510210;'The Master Field for QCD and $q$-Deformed Quantum Field Theory';'I.Ya.Aref'eva and I.V.Volovich';'Sun, 29 Oct 95 21:31:59 +0300 (MSK)   (11kb)';'   The master fields for the large $N$ limit of matrix models and gauge theory are constructed. The master fields satisfy to standard equations of relativistic field theory but fields are quantized according to a new rule. To define the master field we use the Yang-Feldman equation with a free field quantized in the Boltzmannian Fock space. The master field for gauge theory does not take values in a finite-dimensional Lie algebra however there is a non-Abelian gauge symmetry. For the construction of the master field it is essential to work in Minkowski space-time and to use the Wightman correlation functions. The BRST quantization of the master field for gauge theory and a loop equation are considered. '
9510211;'Tau-functions as highest weight vectors for W_{1+infty} algebra';'B.Bakalov, E.Horozov, M.Yakimov (Sofia University, Bulgaria)';'Mon, 30 Oct 1995 17:11:40 +0200 (WET)   (11kb)';'   For each r = (r_1, r_2,...,r_N) we construct a highest weight module M_r of the Lie algebra W_{1+infty}. The highest weight vectors are specific tau-functions of the N-th Gelfand--Dickey hierarchy. We show that these modules are quasifinite and we give a complete description of the reducible ones together with a formula for the singular vectors.     This paper is the first of a series of papers (q-alg/9602010, q-alg/9602011, q-alg/9602012) on the bispectral problem. '
9510212;'Black Hole Information vs. Locality';'N. Itzhaki';'Mon, 30 Oct 1995 10:55:36 +0200 (IST)   (12kb)';'   We discuss the limitations on space time measurement in the Schwarzchild metric. We find that near the horizon the limitations on space time measurement are of the order of the black hole radius. We suggest that it indicates that a large mass black hole cannot be described by means of local field theory even at macroscopic distances and that any attempt to describe black hole formation and evaporation by means of an effective local field theory will necessarily lead to information loss. We also present a new interpretation of the black hole entropy which leads to $S=cA$ , where $c$ is a constant of order $1$ which does not depend on the number of fields. '
9510213;'Doubly Supersymmetric Geometric Approach for Heterotic String: from';'Igor A. Bandos';'Mon, 30 Oct 1995 14:06:35 +0200   (19kb)';'   The previously proposed generalized action principle approach to supersymmetric extended objects is considered in some details for the case of heterotic string in $D=3, 4, 6 ~and~ 10$ space--time dimensions. The proof of the 'off--shell' superdiffeomorphism invariance of the generalized action is presented. The doubly supersymmetric geometric approach to heterotic string is constructed on the basis of generalized action principle (instead of the geometrodynamic condition, used for this previously). It is demonstrated that $D=3$ heterotic string is described by $n=(1,0)$ supersymmetric generalization of the nonlinear Liouville equation. '
9510215;'The Scalar Potential in Noncommutative Geometry';'A. H. Chamseddine (ETH-Zuerich)';'Mon, 30 Oct 1995 12:09:17 +0100   (8kb)';'   We present a derivation of the general form of the scalar potential in Yang-Mills theory of a non-commutative space which is a product of a four-dimensional manifold times a discrete set of points. We show that a non-trivial potential without flat directions is obtained after eliminating the auxiliary fields only if constraints are imposed on the mass matrices utilised in the Dirac operator. The constraints and potential are related to a prepotential function. '
9510216;'On a Zero Curvature Representation for Bosonic Strings and $p$-Branes';'Igor A. Bandos';'Mon, 30 Oct 1995 14:04:29 +0200   (15kb)';'   It is shown that a zero curvature representation for $D$-- dimensional $p$-- brane equations of motion originates naturally in the geometric (Lund- Regge- Omnes) approach. To study the possibility to use this zero curvature representation for investigation of nonlinear equations of $p$-- branes, the simplest case of $D$-- dimensional string ($p=1$) is considered. The connection is found between the $SO(1,1)$ gauge (world--sheet Lorentz) invariance of the string theory with a nontrivial dependence on a spectral parameter of the Lax matrices associated with the nonlinear equations describing the embedding of a string world sheet into flat $D$-- dimensional space -- time. Namely, the spectral parameter can be identified with a parameter of constant $SO(1,1)$ gauge transformations, after the deformation of the Lax matrices has been performed. '
9510217;'Noncommutative Lattices as Finite Approximations and Their';'A.P. Balachandran, G. Bimonte, E. Ercolessi, G. Landi, F. Lizzi, G.';'Mon, 30 Oct 95 13:30:09 +0100   (120kb)';'   Lattice discretizations of continuous manifolds are common tools used in a variety of physical contexts. Conventional discrete approximations, however, cannot capture all aspects of the original manifold, notably its topology. In this paper we discuss an approximation scheme due to Sorkin which correctly reproduces important topological aspects of continuum physics. The approximating topological spaces are partially ordered sets (posets), the partial order encoding the topology. Now, the topology of a manifold $M$ can be reconstructed from the commutative C*-algebra $\cc(M)$ of continuous functions defined on it. In turn, this algebra is generated by continuous probability densities in ordinary quantum physics on $M$. The latter also serve to specify the domains of observables like the Hamiltonian. For a poset, the role of this algebra is assumed by a noncommutative C$^*$-algebra $\ca $. This fact makes any poset a genuine `noncommutative' (`quantum') space, in the sense that the algebra of its `continuous functions' is a noncommutative C$^*$-algebra. We therefore also have a remarkable connection between finite approximations to quantum physics and noncommutative geometries. We use this connection to develop various approximation methods for doing quantum physics using $\ca$. '
9510218;'Gromov-Witten Invariants via Algebraic Geometry';'Sheldon Katz';'Mon, 30 Oct 95 13:41:24 CST   (11kb)';'   Calculations of the number of curves on a Calabi-Yau manifold via an instanton expansion do not always agree with what one would expect naively. It is explained how to account for continuous families of instantons via deformation theory and excess intersection theory. The essential role played by degenerate instantons is also explained. This paper is a slightly expanded version of the author's talk at the June 1995 Trieste Conference on S-Duality and Mirror Symmetry. '
9510219;'Singular Perturbations in Quantum Field Theory';'V.E. Rochev and P.A. Saponov';'Mon, 30 Oct 1995 16:47:08 GMT+03:00   (7kb)';'   In this talk we discuss a new approximation scheme for non-perturbative calculations in a quantum field theory which is based on the fact that the Schwinger equation of a quantum field model belongs to the class of singularly perturbed equations. The self-interacting scalar field and the Gross-Neveu model are taken as the examples and some non-perturbative solutions of an equation for the propagator are found for these models. The application to QCD is also discussed. '
9510220;'New supersymmetric generalization of the Liouville equation';'Igor Bandos, Dmitrij Sorokin and Dmitrij Volkov';'Mon, 30 Oct 1995 17:55:37 +0100 (WET)   (10kb)';'   We present new $n=(1,1)$ and $n=(1,0)$ supersymmetric generalization of the Liouville equation, which originate from a geometrical approach to describing the classical dynamics of Green--Schwarz superstrings in $N=2,~D=3$ and $N=1,~D=3$ target superspace. Considered are a zero curvature representation and B\"acklund transformations associated with the supersymmetric non--linear equations. '
9510221;'Quark mass correction to the string potential';'G. Lambiase and V.V. Nesterenko';'Mon, 30 Oct 1995 20:24:02   (34kb)';'   A consistent method for calculating the interquark potential generated by the relativistic string with massive ends is proposed. In this approach the interquark potential in the model of the Nambu--Goto string with point--like masses at its ends is calculated. At first the calculation is done in the one--loop approximation and then the variational estimation is performed. The quark mass correction results in decreasing the critical distance (deconfinement radius). When quark mass decreases the critical distance also decreases. For obtaining a finite result under summation over eigenfrequencies of the Nambu--Goto string with massive ends a suitable mode--by--mode subtraction is proposed. This renormalization procedure proves to be completely unique. In the framework of the developed approach the one--loop interquark potential in the model of the relativistic string with rigidity is also calculated. '
9510222;'Chiral Rings, Singularity Theory and Electric-Magnetic Duality';'D. Kutasov, A. Schwimmer and N. Seiberg';'Mon, 30 Oct 1995 13:55:31 -0500   (37kb)';'   We study in detail the space of perturbations of a pair of dual $N=1$ supersymmetric theories based on an $SU(N_c)$ gauge theory with an adjoint $X$ and fundamentals with a superpotential which is polynomial in $X$. The equivalence between them depends on non-trivial facts about polynomial equations, i.e.\ singularity theory. The classical chiral rings of the two theories are different. Quantum mechanically there are new relations in the chiral rings which ensure their equivalence. Duality interchanges ``trivial'' classical relations in one theory with quantum relations in the other and vice versa. We also speculate about the behavior of the theory without the superpotential. '
9510223;'String Unification, Higher-Level Gauge Symmetries, and Exotic';'Keith R. Dienes, Alon E. Faraggi, and John March-Russell';'Mon, 30 Oct 1995 21:29:10 -0500   (105kb)';'   We explore the extent to which string theories with higher-level gauge symmetries and non-standard hypercharge normalizations can reconcile the discrepancy between the string unification scale and the GUT scale extrapolated from the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). We determine the phenomenologically allowed regions of (k_Y,k_2,k_3) parameter space, and investigate the proposal that there might exist string models with exotic hypercharge normalizations k_Y which are less than their usual value k_Y=5/3. For a broad class of heterotic string models (encompassing most realistic string models which have been constructed), we prove that k_Y >= 5/3. Beyond this class, however, we show that there exist consistent MSSM embeddings which lead to k_Y < 5/3. We also consider the constraints imposed on k_Y by demanding charge integrality of all unconfined string states, and show that only a limited set of hypercolor confining groups and corresponding values of k_Y are possible. '
9510224;'Towards effective topological gauge theories on spectral curves';'A.Gorsky, A.Marshakov';'Mon, 30 Oct 1995 22:58:10 EET   (14kb)';'   We discuss a general approach to the nonperturbative treatment of quantum field theories based on existence of effective gauge theory on auxiliary ''spectral" Riemann curve. We propose an effective formulation for the exact solutions to some examples of $2d$ string models and $4d$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories and consider their natural generalizations. '
9510225;'D-Strings on D-Manifolds';'M. Bershadsky, V. Sadov and C. Vafa';'Mon, 30 Oct 95 15:40:14 -0500   (37kb)';'   We study the mechanism for appearance of massless solitons in type II string compactifications. We find that by combining $T$-duality with strong/weak duality of type IIB in 10 dimensions enhanced gauge symmetries and massless solitonic hypermultiplets encountered in Calabi-Yau compactifications can be studied perturbatively using D-strings (the strong/weak dual to type IIB string) compactified on ``D-manifolds''. In particular the nearly massless solitonic states of the type IIB compactifications correspond to elementary states of D-strings. As examples we consider the D-string description of enhanced gauge symmetries for type IIA string compactification on ALE spaces with $A_n$ singularities and type IIB on a class of singular Calabi-Yau threefolds. The class we study includes as a special case the conifold singularity in which case the perturbative spectrum of the D-string includes the expected massless hypermultiplet with degeneracy one. '

9510227;'New Vacua for Type II String Theory';'Joseph Polchinski and Andrew Strominger';'Mon, 30 Oct 95 15:12:56 PST   (10kb)';'   Lorentz-invariant expectation values for antisymmetric tensor field strengths in Calabi-Yau compactification of IIA string theory are considered. These are found to impart magnetic and/or electric charges to the dilaton hypermultiplet. This results in a potential which can have supersymmetric minima at zero coupling or at conifold points in the moduli space. The latter occurs whenever the dilaton charge is aligned with that of the light black hole at the conifold. It is shown that there is a flat direction extending from the conifold along which there is a black hole condensate whose strength is of order the string coupling $g_s$. It is speculated that these new vacua correspond to string compactification on generalized Calabi-Yau spaces which have $c_1=0$ but are not Kahler. '
9510228;'A Chiral $SU(N)$ Gauge Theory and its Non-Chiral $Spin(8)$ Dual';'P. Pouliot and M.J. Strassler (Rutgers University)';'Tue, 31 Oct 1995 00:09:47 -0500   (11kb)';'   We study supersymmetric $SU(N-4)$ gauge theories with a symmetric tensor and $N$ antifundamental representations. The theory with $W=0$ has a dual description in terms of a non-chiral $Spin(8)$ theory with one spinor and $N$ vectors. This duality flows to the $SO(N)$ duality of Seiberg and to a duality proposed by one of us. It also flows to dualities for a number of $Spin(m)$ theories, $m\le 8$. For $N=6$, when an ${\cal N}=2$ SUSY superpotential is added, the singularities of Seiberg and Witten are recovered. For $N\le 6$, a mass for the spinor generates the branches of $SO(8)$ theories found by Intriligator and Seiberg. Other phenomena include a classical constraint mapped to an anomaly equation under duality and an intricate consistency check on the renormalization group flow. '
9510229;'A Note on Marginally Stable Bound States in Type II String Theory';'Ashoke Sen';'Tue, 31 Oct 95 13:01:53 -2359   (7kb)';'   Spectrum of elementary string states in type II string theory contains ultra-short multiplets that are marginally stable. $U$-duality transformation converts these states into bound states at threshold of $p$-branes carrying Ramond-Ramond charges, and wrapped around $p$-cycles of a torus. We propose a test for the existence of these marginally stable bound states. Using the recent results of Polchinski and of Witten, we argue that the spectrum of bound states of $p$-branes is in agreement with the prediction of $U$-duality. '
9510230;'Classical and quasi-classical aspects of supersymmetric quantum';'Georg Junker, Stephan Matthiesen and Akira Inomata';'Tue, 31 Oct 1995 09:47:28 +0100   (10kb)';'   A recent development of the studies on classical and quasi-classical properties of supersymmetric quantum mechanics in Witten's version is reviewed. First, classical mechanics of a supersymmetric system is considered. Solutions of the classical equations of motion are given and their properties are discussed in some detail. The corresponding quantum model is constructed by canonical quantization. The quantum model is analyzed by Feynman's path integral within a stationary-phase approximation. A quasi-classical quantization rule is derived, which is applicable when supersymmetry is exact or spontaneously broken. '
9510231;'How to Create a 2-D Black Hole';'V. Frolov, S. Hendy and A.L. Larsen';'Tue, 31 Oct 95 18:48:28 -0700   (17kb)';'   The interaction of a cosmic string with a four-dimensional stationary black hole is considered. If a part of an infinitely long string passes close to a black hole it can be captured. The final stationary configurations of such captured strings are investigated. A uniqueness theorem is proved, namely it is shown that the minimal 2-D surface $\Sigma$ describing a captured stationary string coincides with a {\it principal Killing surface}, i.e. a surface formed by Killing trajectories passing through a principal null ray of the Kerr-Newman geometry. Geometrical properties of principal Killing surfaces are investigated and it is shown that the internal geometry of $\Sigma$ coincides with the geometry of a 2-D black or white hole ({\it string hole}). The equations for propagation of string perturbations are shown to be identical with the equations for a coupled pair of scalar fields 'living' in the spacetime of a 2-D string hole. Some interesting features of physics of 2-D string holes are described. In particular, it is shown that the existence of the extra dimensions of the surrounding spacetime makes interaction possible between the interior and exterior of a string black hole; from the point of view of the 2-D geometry this interaction is acausal. Possible application of this result to the information loss puzzle is briefly discussed. '
9510233;'Notes on a singular Landau-Ginzburg family';'Debashis Ghoshal';'Tue, 31 Oct 95 21:48:07 -2359   (14kb)';'   We study some properties of a singular Landau-Ginzburg family characterized by the multi-variable superpotential $W=-X^{-1}(Y_1Y_2)^{n-1} + {1\over n} (Y_1Y_2)^n - Y_3Y_4$. We will argue that (the infra-red limit of) this theory describes the topological degrees of freedom of the $c=1$ string compactified at $n$ times the self-dual radius. We also briefly comment on the possible realization of these line singularities as singularities of Calabi-Yau manifolds. '
9510234;'On the Ubiquity of K3 Fibrations in String Duality';'Paul S. Aspinwall , Jan Louis';'Tue, 31 Oct 1995 11:34:38 -0500   (21kb)';'   We consider the general case of N=2 dual pairs of type IIA/heterotic string theories in four dimensions. We show that if the type IIA string in this pair can be viewed as having been compactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold in the usual way then this manifold must be of the form of a K3 fibration. We also see how the bound on the rank of the gauge group of the perturbative heterotic string has a natural interpretation on the type IIA side. '
9510235;'Conserved currents for unconventional supersymmetric couplings of';'Ch. Devchand and V. Ogievetsky';'Tue, 31 Oct 1995 19:54:27 -0300   (8kb)';'   Self-dual gauge potentials admit supersymmetric couplings to higher-spin fields satisfying interacting forms of the first order Dirac--Fierz equation. The interactions are governed by conserved currents determined by supersymmetry. These super-self-dual Yang-Mills systems provide on-shell supermultiplets of arbitrarily extended super-Poincar\'e algebras; classical consistency not setting any limit on the extension N. We explicitly display equations of motion up to the $N=6$ extension. The stress tensor, which vanishes for the $N\le 3$ self-duality equations, not only gets resurrected when $N=4$, but is then a member of a conserved multiplet of gauge-invariant tensors. '
9510236;'Light Monopoles, Electric Vortices and Instantons';'Juan Mateos Guilarte';'Tue, 31 Oct 1995 18:23:19 +0100   (9kb)';'   The physics of the bare Seiberg-Witten action, without supersymmetric partners, is considered in the framework of standard Quantum Field Theory. The topological analysis related to the solutions of the Seiberg-Witten equations is performed and the phase structure of the model is analysed. '
9510237;'Significance of the Spinorial Basis in the Quantum Theory';'Valeri V. Dvoeglazov (Zacatecas U., M\'exico)';'Tue, 31 Oct 1995 11:57:27 -0600 (CST)   (6kb)';'   Problems connected with a choice of the spinorial basis in the $(j,0)\oplus (0,j)$ representation space are discussed. As shown it has profound significance in the relativistic quantum theory. From the methodological viewpoint this fact is related with the important dynamical role played by space-time symmetries for all kind of interactions. '
9510238;'Fermion-Fermion and Boson-Boson Amplitudes: Surprising Similarities';'Valeri V. Dvoeglazov (Zacatecas U., M\'exico)';'Tue, 31 Oct 1995 11:59:15 -0600 (CST)   (5kb)';'   Amplitudes for boson-boson and fermion-boson interactions are calculated in the second order of perturbation theory in the Lobachevsky space. An essential ingredient of the used model is the Weinberg's $2(2j+1)$ component formalism for describing a particle of spin $j$, recently developed substantially. The boson-boson amplitude is then compared with the two-fermion amplitude obtained by Skachkov long ago on the ground of the hamiltonian formulation of quantum field theory on the mass hyperboloid, $p_0^2 -{\vec p}^{2}=M^2$, proposed by Kadyshevsky. The parametrization of the amplitudes by means of the momentum transfer in the Lobachevsky space leads to same spin structures in the expressions of $T$ matrices for the fermion and the boson cases. However, certain differences are found. Possible physical applications are discussed. '

The presence of all the sub-algebras of $W_\infty$ is shown in this model. A simplified proof for this algebra, in the symmetric ordered basics, is given. It is pointed out that the algebra contains in general, nonlinear terms. Possible connection to the nonlinear $W_\infty$ is discussed. '
9510240;'Non-Trivial Directions for Scalar Fields';'Ken Halpern and Kerson Huang (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)';'Tue, 31 Oct 95 13:24:40 -0500   (94kb)';'   We study the eigenvectors of the renormalization-group matrix for scalar fields at the Gaussian fixed point, and find that that there exist ``relevant'' directions in parameter space. They correspond to theories with exponential potentials that are nontrivial and asymptotically free. All other potentials, including polynomial potentials, are ``irrelevant,'' and lead to trivial theories. Away from the Gaussian fixed point, renormalization does not induce derivative couplings, but it generates non-local interactions. '
9510241;'Three Generations in the Fermionic Construction';'Shyamoli Chaudhuri, George Hockney, and Joseph D. Lykken';'Tue, 31 Oct 1995 14:58:29 -0800   (34kb)';'   We obtain three generation SU(3)_c X SU(2)_L X U(1)_Y string models in all of the exactly solvable (0,2) constructions sampled by fermionization. None of these examples, including those that are symmetric abelian orbifolds, rely on the Z_2 X Z_2 orbifold underlying the NAHE basis. We present the first known three generation models for which the hypercharge normalization, k_1, takes values smaller than that obtained from an SU(5) embedding, thus lowering the effective gauge coupling unification scale. All of the models contain fractional electrically charged and vectorlike exotic matter that could survive in the light spectrum. '

By evaluating the action of the Yangian generators $Q_{0}^{a}, Q_{1}^{a}$ and the Hamiltonian $H_2$ on two spinon states we get a new connection between this conformal field theory and the Calogero-Sutherland model with $SU(N)$ spin. This connection clearly confirms the need for the $W_3$ generator in $H_2$ and an additional term in the $Q^{a}_{1}$. We also evaluate some energy spectra of $H_2$, by acting it on multi-spinon states. '

Alexander Bais';'Tue, 28 Nov 1995 19:38:42 +0100 (MET)   (90kb)';'   In these lecture notes, we present a self-contained discussion of planar gauge theories broken down to some finite residual gauge group H via the Higgs mechanism. The main focus is on the discrete H gauge theory describing the long distance physics of such a model. The spectrum features global H charges, magnetic vortices and dyonic combinations. Due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect, these particles exhibit topological interactions. Among other things, we review the Hopf algebra related to this discrete H gauge theory, which provides an unified description of the spin, braid and fusion properties of the particles in this model. Exotic phenomena such as flux metamorphosis, Alice fluxes, Cheshire charge, (non)abelian braid statistics, the generalized spin-statistics connection and nonabelian Aharonov-Bohm scattering are explained and illustrated by representative examples.

In each case, the solutions preserve half of the original supersymmetry. These solutions make use of the metric and dilaton fields only.

We then also briefly describe a present study aimed at extending the known web of interconnections between Calabi-Yau manifolds. We show, for instance, that all 7555 Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in weighted projective four space are mathematically connected by extremal transitions. '
9511205;'Quantum dynamics of N=1, D=4 supergravity chiral compensator';'I.L.Buchbinder and A.Yu.Petrov (Department of Theoretical Physics,';'Wed, 29 Nov 1995 11:48:41 +0700 (TSK)   (15kb)';'   A new four-dimensional $N=1$ superfield model is suggested. The model is induced by supertrace anomaly of matter superfields in curved superspace and leads to effective theory of supergravity chiral compensator. A renormalization structure of this model is studied, one-loop counterterms are calculated and renormalization group equations are investigated. It is shown that the theory under consideration is infrared free. '

The results interpolate the well-known result of $CP^{N-2}$ model and the one of Calabi-Yau hypersuface in $CP^{N-1}$. We find in $k\leq N-2$ case, principal relation of this ring have very simple form compatible with toric compactification of moduli space of holomorphic maps from $CP^{1}$ to $CP^{N-1}$. '

Valtancoli';'Wed, 29 Nov 1995 13:14:01 +0100 (CET)   (32kb)';'   We construct a non-perturbative, single-valued solution for the metric and the motion of $N$ interacting particles in $2+1$-Gravity. The solution is explicit for two particles with any speed and for any number of particles with small speed. It is based on a mapping from multivalued Minkowskian coordinates to single-valued ones, which solves the non-abelian monodromies due to particles' momenta. The two and three-body cases are treated in detail. '
9511208;'The Other Spectral Flow';'Beatriz Gato-Rivera and Jose Ignacio Rosado';'Wed, 29 Nov 1995 13:33:34 UTC+0100   (9kb)';'   Recently we showed that the spectral flow acting on the N=2 twisted topological theories gives rise to a topological algebra automorphism. Here we point out that the untwisting of that automorphism leads to a spectral flow on the untwisted N=2 superconformal algebra which is different from the usual one. This "other" spectral flow does not interpolate between the chiral ring and the antichiral ring. In particular, it maps the chiral ring into the chiral ring and the antichiral ring into the antichiral ring. We discuss the similarities and differences between both spectral flows. We also analyze their action on null states. '

Magnoli';'Wed, 29 Nov 1995 13:55:47 +0200 (MET)   (23kb)';'   We consider here renormalizable theories without relevant couplings and present an I.R. consistent technique to study corrections to short distance behavior (Wilson O.P.E. coefficients) due to a relevant perturbation. Our method is the result of a complete reformulation of recent works on the field, and is characterized by a more orthodox treatment of U.V. divergences that allows for simpler formulae and consequently an explicit all order (regularization invariant) I.R. finitess proof. Underlying hypotheses are discussed in detail and found to be satisfied in conformal theories that constitute a natural field of application of this approach. '
9511210;'Modular Invariance and the Odderon';'Romuald Janik';'Wed, 29 Nov 1995 13:22:49 +0100   (8kb)';'   We identify a new symmetry for the equations governing odderon amplitudes, corresponding in the Regge limit of QCD to the exchange of 3 reggeized gluons. The symmetry is a modular invariance with respect to the unique normal subgroup of sl(2,Z) {\,} of index 2.  This leads to a natural description of the Hamiltonian and conservation-law operators as acting on the moduli space of elliptic curves with a fixed ``sign'': elliptic curves are identified if they can be transformed into each other by an {\em even} number of Dehn twists.

9511211;'Some approaches to 2+1-dimensional gravity coupled to point-particles';'Max Welling (Institute of Theoretical Physics Utrecht)';'Wed, 29 Nov 1995 14:12:47 +0100 (GMT+0100)   (27kb)';'   In these notes we will review some approaches to 2+1 dimensional gravity and the way it is coupled to point-particles. First we look into some exact static and stationary solutions with and without cosmological constant. Next we study the polygon approach invented by 't Hooft. The third section treats the Chern-Simonons formulation of 2+1-gravity. In the last part we map the problem of finding the gravitational field around point-particles to the Riemann-Hilbert problem.

9511212;'Generalised Hamiltonian embedding of the Proca model';'N. Banerjee and R. Banerjee';'Wed, 29 Nov 95 20:30:24+050   (7kb)';'   We convert the second class Proca model into a first class theory by using the generalised prescription of Batalin, Fradkin and Tyutin. We then show how a basic set of gauge invariant fields in the embedded model can be identified with the fundamental fields in the proca model as well as with the observables in the St\"uckelberg model or in the model involving the interaction of an abelian 2-form field with the Maxwell field. The connection of these models with the massive Kalb-Ramond model is also elucidated within a path integral approach. '
9511213;'Dualities in Five Dimensions and Charged String Solutions';'Supriya Kar, Jnanadeva Maharana and Sudhakar Panda';'Wed, 29 Nov 1995 22:27:11 +0500   (17kb)';'   We consider an eleven dimensional supergravity compactified on $K3\times T^2$ and show that the resulting five dimensional theory has identical massless states as that of heterotic string compactified on a specific five torus $T^5$. The strong-weak coupling duality of the five dimensional theory is argued to represent a ten dimensional Type $IIA$ string compactified on $K3 \times S^1$, supporting the conjecture of string-string duality in six dimensions. In this perspective, we present magnetically charged solution of the low energy heterotic string effective action in five dimensions with a charge defined on a three sphere $S^3$ due to the two form potential. We use the Poincare duality to replace the antisymmetric two form with a gauge field in the effective action and obtain a string solution with charge on a two sphere $S^2$ instead of that on a three sphere $S^3$ in the five dimensional spacetime. We note that the string-particle duality is accompanied by a change of topology from $S^3$ to $S^2$ and viceversa. '
9511214;'Degrees of freedom in two dimensional string theory';'Sumit R. Das';'Thu, 30 Nov 95 00:17:17 -2359   (16kb)';'   We discuss two issues regarding the question of degrees of freedom in two dimensional string theory. The first issue relates to the classical limit of quantum string theory. In the classical theory one requires an infinite number of fields in addition to the collective field to describe ``folds'' on the fermi surface. We argue that in the quantum theory these are not additional degrees of freedom. Rather they represent quantum dispersions of the collective field which are {\em not} suppressed when $\hbar \rightarrow 0$ whenever a fold is present, thus leading to a nontrivial classical limit. The second issue relates to the ultraviolet properties of the geometric entropy. We argue that the geometric entropy is finite in the ultraviolet due to {\em nonperturbative} effects. This indicates that the true degrees of freedom of the two dimensional string at high energies is much smaller than what one naively expects.  (Based on talks at Spring Workshop on String theory and Quantum Gravity, ICTP, Trieste, March 1995 and VIIth Regional Conference on Mathematical Physics, Bandar-Anzali, October 1995.) '
9511215;'Reduction of the Two Body Problem in N=2 Chern Simons Supergravity';'Sumne Kim and F. Mansouri';'Wed, 29 Nov 1995 15:02:05 -0500 (EST)   (8kb)';'   By an extension of the methods used for the reduction of the two body problem in 2+1 dimensional gravity, we show that the two body problem in N=2 Chern Simons supergravity can be reduced exactly to an equivalent on body formalism. We give exact expressions for the invariants of the reduced one body problem. '
9511216;'Modular Covariance and the Algebraic PCT/Spin-Statistics Theorem';'D. R. Davidson';'Wed, 29 Nov 1995 15:17:16 -0700 (MST)   (21kb)';'   In the theory of nets of observable algebras, the modular operators associated with wedge regions are expected to have a natural geometric action, a generalization of the Bisognano-Wichmann condition for nets associated with Poincare-covariant fields. Here many possible such modular covariance conditions are discussed (in spacetime of at least three dimensions), including several conditions previously proposed and known to imply versions of the PCT and spin-statistics theorems. The logical relations between these conditions are explored: for example, it is shown that most of them are equivalent, and that all of them follow from appropriate commutation relations for the modular automorphisms alone. These results allow us to reduce the study of modular covariance to the case of systems describing non-interacting particles. Given finitely many Poincare-covariant non-interacting particles of any given mass, it is shown that modular covariance and wedge duality must hold, and the modular operators for wedge regions must have the Bisognano-Wichmann form, so that the usual free fields are the only possibility. For models describing interacting particles, it is shown that if they have a complete scattering interpretation in terms of such non-interacting particles, then again modular covariance and wedge duality must hold, and the modular operators for wedge regions must have the Bisognano-Wichmann form, so that wedge duality and the PCT and spin-statistics theorems must hold.

9511217;'Renormalizability of Quantum Gravity near Two Dimensions';'H. Kawai, Y. Kitazawa and M. Ninomiya';'Thu, 30 Nov 1995 12:13:04 +0900   (17kb)';'   We study the renormalizability of quantum gravity near two dimensions. Our formalism starts with the tree action which is invariant under the volume preserving diffeomorphism. We identify the BRS invariance which originates from the full diffeomorphism invariance. We study the Ward-Takahashi identities to determine the general structure of the counter terms. We prove to all orders that the counter terms can be supplied by the coupling and the wave function renormalization of the tree action. The bare action can be constructed to be the Einstein action form which ensures the full diffeomorphism invariance. '
9511218;'Black Hole Geometry around an Elementary BPS String State';'Gautam Mandal and Spenta R. Wadia';'Thu, 30 Nov 95 12:58:39 IST   (13kb)';'   We probe the geometry around an elementary BPS (EBPS) state in heterotic string theory compactified on a six-torus by scattering a massless scalar off it and comparing with the corresponding experiment in which the EBPS state is replaced by a classical extremal black hole background satisfying the BPS condition. We find that the low energy limit of the scattering amplitudes precisely agree if one takes the limit $m_{\rm bh} >> m_P$. In the classical experiment, beyond a certain frequency of the incident wave, part of the wave is found to be absorbed by the black hole, whereas in case of the string scattering there is a critical frequency (inelastic threshold) of the probe beyond which the EBPS state gets excited to a higher mass non-BPS elementary state. The classical absorption threshold matches exactly with the inelastic threshold in the limit of maximum degeneracy of the EBPS state of a given mass. In that limit we can therefore identify absorption by the black hole as excitation of the elementary string state to the next vibrational state of the string and consequently also identify the non-BPS string state as a non-extremal black hole.

9511219;'Higher Derivatives and Canonical Formalisms';'Takao Nakamura and Shinji Hamamoto';'Thu, 30 Nov 1995 16:52:42 +0900   (9kb)';'   Path integral expressions for three canonical formalisms -- Ostrogradski's one, constrained one and generalized one -- of higher-derivative theories are given. For each fomalism we consider both nonsingular and singular cases. It is shown that three formalisms share the same path integral expressions. In paticular it is pointed out that the generalized canonical formalism is connected with the constrained one by a canonical transformation. '
9511220;'Macroscopic $n$-Loop Amplitude for Minimal Models Coupled to';'M. Anazawa and H. Itoyama';'Thu, 30 Nov 95 20:48:01 +0900   (52kb)';'   We investigate the structure of the macroscopic $n$-loop amplitude obtained from the two-matrix model at the unitary minimal critical point $(m+1,m)$. We derive a general formula for the $n$-resolvent correlator at the continuum planar limit whose inverse Laplace transform provides the amplitude in terms of the boundary lengths $\ell_{i}$ and the renormalized cosmological constant $t$. The amplitude is found to contain a term consisting of $\left( \frac{\partial} {\partial t} \right)^{n-3}$ multiplied by the product of modified Bessel functions summed over their degrees which conform to the fusion rules and the crossing symmetry. This is found to be supplemented by an increasing number of other terms with $n$ which represent residual interactions of loops. We reveal the nature of these interactions by explicitly determining them as the convolution of modified Bessel functions and their derivatives for the case $n=4$ and the case $n=5$. We derive a set of recursion relations which relate the terms in the $n$-resolvents to those in the $(n-1)$-resolvents. '
9511221;'Continuum and Lattice Overlap for Chiral Fermions on the Torus';'C.D. Fosco';'Thu, 30 Nov 1995 16:55:28 +0100 (MET)   (14kb)';'   The overlap formulation is applied to calculate the chiral determinant on a two-dimensional torus with twisted boundary conditions. We evaluate first the continuum overlap, which is convergent and well-defined, and yields the correct string theory result for both the real and imaginary parts of the effective action. We then show that the lattice version of the overlap gives the continuum overlap results in the limit when the lattice spacing tends to zero, and that the subleading terms in that limit are irrelevant.

9511222;'D-Branes and Topological Field Theories';'M. Bershadsky, V. Sadov and C. Vafa';'Thu, 30 Nov 95 15:01:48 -0500   (17kb)';'   In the presence of a D-brane a string theory develops a new subsector. We show that for curved D-branes the corresponding sector is a (partially twisted) topological field theory. We use this result to compute the degeneracy of 2-branes wrapped around $K3$ cycles as well as 3-branes wrapped around CY threefold vanishing 3-cycles. In both cases we find the degeneracy is in accord with expectation. The counting of BPS states of a gas of 0-branes in the presence of a 4-brane in $K3$ is considered and it is noted that the effective 0-brane charge is shifted by 1, due to a quantum correction. This is in accord with string duality and the fact that left-moving ground state energy of heterotic string starts at $-1$. We also show that all the three different topological twistings of four dimensional $N=4$ Yang-Mills theory do arise from curved three-branes embedded in different spaces (Calabi-Yau manifolds and manifolds with exceptional holonomy groups).

9511223;'Four-Dimensional Higher-Derivative Supergravity and Spontaneous';'Ahmed Hindawi, Burt A. Ovrut, Daniel Waldram';'Thu, 30 Nov 1995 14:13:55 -0500   (30kb)';'   We construct two classes of higher-derivative supergravity theories generalizing Einstein supergravity. We explore their dynamical content as well as their vacuum structure. The first class is found to be equivalent to Einstein supergravity coupled to a single chiral superfield. It has a unique stable vacuum solution except in a special case, when it becomes identical to a simple no-scale theory. The second class is found to be equivalent to Einstein supergravity coupled to two chiral superfields and has a richer vacuum structure. It is demonstrated that theories of the second class can possess a stable vacuum with vanishing cosmological constant that spontaneously breaks supersymmetry. We present an explicit example of this phenomenon and compare the result with the Polonyi model. '
9511224;'Catalysis of Dynamical Symmetry Breaking by a Magnetic Field';'V.A.Miransky';'Thu, 30 Nov 1995 14:54:52 EDT   (13kb)';'   A constant magnetic field in 3+1 and 2+1 dimensions is a strong catalyst of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, leading to the generation of a fermion mass even at the weakest attractive interaction between fermions. The essence of this effect is the dimensional reduction $D/rightarrow D-2$ in the dynamics of fermion pairing in a magnetic field. The effect is illustrated in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model and QED. Possible applications of this effect and its extension to inhomogeneous field configurations are discussed. '
9511225;'The generic soliton of the $A_n$ affine Toda field theories';'Edwin J. Beggs, Peter R. Johnson (Wales, Swansea)';'Thu, 30 Nov 1995 20:11:50 GMT   (46kb)';'   In this note we show that the single soliton solutions known previously in the $1+1$ dimensional affine Toda field theories from a variety of different methods \cite{H1,MM,OTUa,OTUb}, are in fact not the most general single soliton solutions. We exhibit single soliton solutions with additional small parameters which reduce to the previously known solutions when these extra parameters are set to zero. The new solution has the same mass and topological charges as the standard solution when these parameters are set to zero. However we cannot yet completely rule out the possibility that other solutions with larger values of these extra parameters are non-singular, in the cases where the number of extra parameters is greater than one, and if so their topological charges would most likely be different.

9511226;'Gauge Invariant Geometric Variables For Yang-Mills Theory';'Peter E. Haagensen, Kenneth Johnson and C.S. Lam';'Thu, 30 Nov 1995 15:32:37 -0500 (EST)   (19kb)';'   In a previous publication [1], local gauge invariant geometric variables were introduced to describe the physical Hilbert space of Yang-Mills theory. In these variables, the electric energy involves the inverse of an operator which can generically have zero modes, and thus its calculation is subtle. In the present work, we resolve these subtleties by considering a small deformation in the definition of these variables, which in the end is removed. The case of spherical configurations of the gauge invariant variables is treated in detail, as well as the inclusion of infinitely heavy point color sources, and the expression for the associated electric field is found explicitly. These spherical geometries are seen to correspond to the spatial components of instanton configurations. The related geometries corresponding to Wu-Yang monopoles and merons are also identified. '

Hawking's information paradox, the theory of the stretched horizon and the principle of black hole complementarity are covered.

9511228;'N=1 Dual String Pairs and Gaugino Condensation';'S. Kachru and E. Silverstein';'Thu, 30 Nov 1995 22:31:05 -0500   (17kb)';'   We study a class of four-dimensional N=1 heterotic string theories which have nontrivial quantum dynamics arising from asymptotically free gauge groups. These models are obtained by orbifolding 4d N=2 heterotic/type II dual pairs by symmetries which leave unbroken products of nonabelian gauge groups (without charged matter) in a ``hidden sector'' on the heterotic side. Such models are expected to break supersymmetry through gaugino condensation in the hidden sector. We find a dual description of the effects of gaugino condensation on the type II side, where the corresponding superpotential arises at tree level. We speculate that the conformal field theory underlying the type II description may be related to a class of geometrical nonsupersymmetric string compactifications. '
9511229;'N=1 and N=2 cosets from gauged supersymmetric WZW models';'Jose M Figueroa-O'Farrill and Sonia Stanciu';'Fri, 1 Dec 95 00:29:12 GMT   (11kb)';'   We present a derivation of the N=1 and N=2 superconformal coset constructions starting from a supersymmetric WZW model where a diagonal subgroup has been gauged. We work in the general framework of self-dual (not necessarily reductive) Lie algebras; but even in the reductive case these results are new. We show that the BRST cohomology of the gauged supersymmetric WZW model contains the N=1 (and if it exists also the N=2) coset generators. We also extend the BRST analysis to show that the BRST cohomology of the supersymmetric WZW model agrees with that of an ordinary bosonic WZW model (in a representation twisted by the presence of the coset fermions). In particular, in the case of the topological G/G coset, the supersymmetric and nonsupersymmetric theories agree. '
9511230;'On the Connectedness of the Moduli Space of Calabi--Yau Manifolds';'A.C. Avram, P. Candelas, D. Jancic, M. Mandelberg';'Thu, 30 Nov 95 23:49:28 GMT-0600   (21kb)';'   We show that the moduli space of all Calabi-Yau manifolds that can be realized as hypersurfaces described by a transverse polynomial in a four dimensional weighted projective space, is connected. This is achieved by exploiting techniques of toric geometry and the construction of Batyrev that relate Calabi-Yau manifolds to reflexive polyhedra. Taken together with the previously known fact that the moduli space of all CICY's is connected, and is moreover connected to the moduli space of the present class of Calabi-Yau manifolds (since the quintic threefold P_4[5] is both CICY and a hypersurface in a weighted P_4, this strongly suggests that the moduli space of all simply connected Calabi-Yau manifolds is connected. It is of interest that singular Calabi-Yau manifolds corresponding to the points in which the moduli spaces meet are often, for the present class, more singular than the conifolds that connect the moduli spaces of CICY's.

It is found that the effective potential for composite operator $\overline{\psi}\psi$ is calculable in the leading order of the $1/N$ expansion. The resulting effective potential is analyzed by varying the curvature of the space-time and is found to exhibit the symmetry restoration through the second-order phase transition. The critical curvature at which the dynamical fermion mass disappears is analytically calculated. '
9512203;'T-Duality of p-Branes';'Ashoke Sen';'Wed, 27 Dec 95 22:09:16 -0155   (7kb)';'   We investigate possible existence of duality symmetries which exchange the Kaluza-Klein modes with the wrapping modes of a BPS saturated $p$-brane on a torus. Assuming the validity of the conjectured $U$-duality symmetries of type II and heterotic string theories and $M$-theory, we show that for a BPS saturated $p$-brane there is an SL(2,Z) symmetry that mixes the Kaluza-Klein modes on a $(p+1)$ dimensional torus $T^{(p+1)}$ with the wrapping modes of the $p$-brane on $T^{(p+1)}$. The field that transforms as a modular parameter under this SL(2,Z) transformation has as its real part the component of the $(p+1)$-form gauge field on $T^{(p+1)}$, and as its imaginary part the volume of $T^{(p+1)}$, measured in the metric that couples naturally to the $p$-brane.

9512204;'On the Classification of Reflexive Polyhedra';'M. Kreuzer and H. Skarke';'Wed, 27 Dec 1995 18:14:52 +0100   (18kb)';'   Reflexive polyhedra encode the combinatorial data for mirror pairs of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties. We investigate the geometrical structures of circumscribed polytopes with a minimal number of facets and of inscribed polytopes with a minimal number of vertices. These objects, which constrain reflexive pairs of polyhedra from the interior and the exterior, can be described in terms of certain non-negative integral matrices. A major tool in the classification of these matrices is the existence of a pair of weight systems, indicating a relation to weighted projective spaces. This is the corner stone for an algorithm for the construction of all dual pairs of reflexive polyhedra that we expect to be efficient enough for an enumerative classification in up to 4 dimensions, which is the relevant case for Calabi-Yau compactifications in string theory.

9512206;'String Field Theory in Rindler Space-Time and String Thermalization';'Hiroyuki Hata, Hajime Oda and Shigeaki Yahikozawa';'Fri, 29 Dec 1995 12:43:33 +0900   (31kb)';'   Quantization of free string field theory in the Rindler space-time is studied by using the covariant formulation and taking the center-of-mass value of the Rindler string time-coordinate $\eta(\sigma)$ as the time variable for quantization. We construct the string Rindler modes which vanish in either of the Rindler wedges $\pm$ defined by the Minkowski center-of-mass coordinate of the string. We then evaluate the Bogoliubov coefficients between the Rindler string creation/annihilation operators and the Minkowski ones, and analyze the string thermalization. An approach to the construction of the string Rindler modes corresponding to different definitions of the wedges is also presented toward a thorough understanding of the structure of the Hilbert space of the string field theory on the Rindler space-time.

The field equations are derived using the post-Newtonian scheme, and the approximate solution is presented for a point mass with electric and dilaton charges. The result indicates that the dilaton effect can be detected, in post-Newtonian level, using a charged test particle but not a neutral one. We have also checked that the approximate solution is indeed consistent with the weak field expansion of charged dilaton black hole solution in the harmonic coordinate. '
9512208;'A perturbative renormalization group approach to light-front Hamiltonian';'Takanori Sugihara and Masanobu Yahiro';'Thu, 28 Dec 1995 19:26:31 +0900   (50kb)';'   A perturbative renormalization group (RG) scheme for light-front Hamiltonian is formulated on the basis of the Bloch-Horowitz effective Hamiltonian, and applied to the simplest $\phi^4$ model with spontaneous breaking of the $Z_2$ symmetry. RG equations are derived at one-loop order for both symmetric and broken phases. The equations are consistent with those calculated in the covariant perturbation theory. For the symmetric phase, an initial cutoff Hamiltonian in the RG procedure is made by excluding the zero mode from the canonical Hamiltonian with an appropriate regularization. An initial cutoff Hamiltonian for the broken phase is constructed by shifting $\phi$ as $\phi \rightarrow\phi-v$ in the initial Hamiltonian for the symmetric phase. The shifted value $v$ is determined on a renormalization trajectory. The minimum of the effective potential occurs on the trajectory. '
9512209;'Eikonal Particle Scattering and Dilaton Gravity';'Saurya Das and Parthasarathi Majumdar';'Thu, 28 Dec 1995 15:44:53 +0530 (GMT+05:30)   (16kb)';'   Approximating light charged point-like particles in terms of (nonextremal) dilatonic black holes is shown to lead to certain pathologies in Planckian scattering in the eikonal approximation, which are traced to the presence of a (naked) curvature singularity in the metric of these black holes. The existence of such pathologies is confirmed by analyzing the problem in an `external metric' formulation where an ultrarelativistic point particle scatters off a dilatonic black hole geometry at large impact parameters. The maladies disappear almost trivially upon imposing the extremal limit. Attempts to derive an effective three dimensional `boundary' field theory in the eikonal limit are stymied by four dimensional (bulk) terms proportional to the light-cone derivatives of the dilaton field, leading to nontrivial mixing of electromagnetic and gravitational effects, in contrast to the case of general relativity. An eikonal scattering amplitude, showing decoupling of these effects, is shown to be derivable by resummation of graviton, dilaton and photon exchange ladder diagrams in a linearized version of the theory, for an asymptotic value of the dilaton field which makes the string coupling constant non-perturbative.

As an explicit example of what happens, I consider the Kazakov-Migdal model with a logarithmic potential which is exactly solvable for any D (at large D for an arbitrary potential). I discuss also the meander problem and report some new results on its representation via matrix models and the relation to the Kazakov-Migdal model. A supersymmetric matrix model is especially useful for describing the principal meanders. '
9512212;'Homology in Abelian Lattice Models';'Mark Rakowski and Siddhartha Sen';'Thu, 28 Dec 1995 18:33:16 +0000   (8kb)';'   We study abelian lattice gauge theory defined on a simplicial complex with arbitrary topology. The use of dual objects allows one to reformulate the theory in terms of new dynamical variables; however, we avoid the use of the dual lattice entirely. Topological modes which are present in the transformation now appear as homology classes, in contrast to the cohomology modes found in the dual cell picture. Irregularities of dual cell complexes do not arise in this approach. We treat the two and three dimensional cases in detail. '

It contains, in addition to the spin 1 N=2 stress tensor, the spins $1/2, 2$ bosonic and spins $1/2, 2$ fermionic supercurrents satisfying the first class nonlinear chiral constraints. In the $c \to \infty $ limit, the ``classical'' N=2 $W_3^{(2)}$ algebra is recovered. '
9512215;'BRST Quantization of Gauge Theory in Noncommutative Geometry: Matrix';'Chang-Yeong Lee, Dae Sung Hwang, Yuval Ne'eman';'Fri, 29 Dec 1995 15:38:38 +0900 (KST)   (15kb)';'   The BRST quantization of a gauge theory in noncommutative geometry is carried out in the ``matrix derivative" approach. BRST/anti-BRST transformation rules are obtained by applying the horizontality condition, in the superconnection formalism. A BRST/anti-BRST invariant quantum action is then constructed, using an adaptation of the method devised by Baulieu and Thierry-Mieg for the Yang-Mills case. The resulting quantum action turns out to be the same as that of a gauge theory in the 't Hooft gauge with spontaneously broken symmetry. Our result shows that only the even part of the supergroup acts as a gauge symmetry, while the odd part effectively provides a global symmetry. We treat the general formalism first, then work out the $SU(2/1)$ and $SU(2/2)$ cases explicitly. '
9512216;'Nonabelian Topological Mass Generation in 4 Dimensions';'Dae Sung Hwang, Chang-Yeong Lee';'Fri, 29 Dec 1995 20:07:02 +0900 (KST)   (10kb)';'   We study the topological mass generation in the 4 dimensional nonabelian gauge theory, which is the extension of the Allen $et$ $al.$'s work in the abelian theory. It is crucial to introduce a one form auxiliary field in constructing the gauge invariant nonabelian action which contains both the one form vector gauge field $A$ and the two form antisymmetric tensor field $B$. As in the abelian case, the topological coupling $m B\wedge F$, where $F$ is the field strength of $A$, makes the transmutation among $A$ and $B$ possible, and consequently we see that the gauge field becomes massive. We find the BRST/anti-BRST transformation rule using the horizontality condition, and construct a BRST/anti-BRST invariant quantum action. '

The procedure is particularly well-suited to models which have a known fusion hierarchy and which are based on graphs containing a node of valency $1$. Among such models are the Andrews-Baxter-Forrester models, for which we construct reflection equation solutions for fixed and free boundary conditions. '

Superconformal invariance is studied. The conserved currents are shown to be associated with Drinfeld-Sokolov type gauges. The extension to non-abelian \n2 Toda equations is discussed. Very similar methods are then applied to a matrix formulation in \n2 superspace of one of the \n2 KdV hierarchies. '

It involves two classical r-matrices, one of which comes from the geometrical constraints implied by $N=2$ supersymmetry. The phase space itself consists of superfields satisfying constraints involving this r-matrix. An attempt is made to relax these constraints. The symmetries of the model are investigated. '
9512222;'Solitonic Black Holes in Gauged N=2 Supergravity';'Alan Kostelecky and Malcolm Perry';'Fri, 29 Dec 95 12:11:57 EST   (12kb)';'   A sequence of zero-temperature black-hole spacetimes with angular momentum and electric and magnetic charges is shown to exist in gauged $N=2$ supergravity. Stability of a subset of these spacetimes is demonstrated by saturation of the Bogomol'nyi bound arising from the supersymmetry algebra. The mass of the resulting solitonic black holes is given in terms of the cosmological constant and the angular momentum. We conjecture that at the quantum level these solitons are dyons with angular momentum determined by the electric and magnetic charges. '
9512223;'Instanton Moduli for T**3xR';'Pierre van Baal (Instituut-Lorentz, University of Leiden)';'Sat, 30 Dec 95 22:54:22 MET   (37kb)';'   We review the specific problems that arise when studying instantons on a torus. We discuss how the Nahm transformation shows that no exact charge one instanton on T**4 can exist. However, taking one of the directions (the time) to infinity, it can be shown that vacuum to vacuum tunnelling solutions exist. A precise description of the moduli space for T**3xR, studied numerically using lattice techniques, remains an interesting open problem. New is an explicit application of the Nahm transformation to (anti-)selfdual constant curvature solutions on T**4 and a discussion of its properties relevant to instantons on T**3xR. '
9512224;'Loop Variables and Gauge Invariant Interactions of Massive Modes in';'B. Sathiapalan';'Sun, 31 Dec 95 10:24 EST   (12kb)';'   The loop variable approach used earlier to obtain free equations of motion for the massive modes of the open string, is generalized to include interaction terms. These terms, which are polynomial, involve only modes of strictly lower mass. Considerations based on operator product expansions suggest that these equations are particular truncations of the full string equations. The method involves broadening the loop to a band of finite thickness that describes all the different interacting strings. Interestingly, in terms of these variables, the theory appears non-interacting. '
9512225;'The Master Field in Generalised $QCD_2$';'Rajesh Gopakumar (Princeton University)';'Sun, 31 Dec 1995 13:45:31 -0500 (EST)   (15kb)';'   As an illustration of the formalism of the master field we consider generalised $QCD_2$. We show how Wilson Loop averages for an arbitrary contour can be computed explicitly and with some ease. A generalised Hopf equation is shown to govern the behaviour of the eigenvalue density of Wilson loops. The collective field description of the theory is therefore deduced. Finally, the non-trivial master gauge field and field strengths are obtained. These results do not seem easily accessible with conventional means. '
9512226;'Monstrous String-String Duality';'S. Chaudhuri and D.A.

A unified treatment is given by considering compactification to two spacetime dimensions and constructing orbifolds by subgroups of the Fischer-Greiss monster, utilizing the moonshine results of Conway and Norton. Duality requires nontrivial Ramond-Ramond fluxes on the Type IIA side which are localized at the fixed points. Further orbifolding by (-1)^{F_L} gives examples of new four dimensional N=2 Type IIA vacua which are not conformal field theory backgrounds. '
9603201;'Symmetry Non Restoration and Inverse Symmetry Breaking on the lattice';'G.Bimonte and G.Lozano';'Fri, 29 Mar 1996 17:07:12 GMT   (11kb)';'   We study the finite temperature symmetry behaviour of O(N_1) \times O(N_2) scalar models on the lattice and we prove that at sufficiently high temperatures and in arbitrary dimensions their full symmetry is always restored or, equivalently, that the phenomenon of Symmetry Non Restoration which, according to lowest order perturbation theory, takes place in the continuum version of these models, does not occur on the lattice.

The complex form yields ``Feynman's Checkerboard''---a weighted sum over lattice paths. The rational, real form can also be interpreted in terms of bit-strings. '
9603204;'Anomaly free U(1) chiral gauge theories on a two dimensional torus';'Rajamani Narayanan, Herbert Neuberger';'Fri, 29 Mar 1996 14:54:45 -0800 (PST)   (31kb)';'   We consider anomaly free combinations of chiral fermions coupled to $U(1)$ gauge fields on a 2D torus first in the continuum and then on the lattice in the overlap formulation. Both in the continuum and on the lattice, when the background consists of sufficiently large constant gauge potentials the action induced by the fermions varies significantly under certain singular gauge transformations. ``Ruling away'' such discontinuities cannot be justified in the continuum framework and does not naturally fit on the lattice. Complete gauge invariance in the continuum can be restored in some models by choosing special boundary conditions for the fermions. Evidence is presented that gauge averaging the overlap phases in these models produces correct continuum results. '
9603205;'The Vacuum in Light-Cone Field Theory';'David G. Robertson (Ohio State)';'Fri, 29 Mar 1996 18:03:23 -0500 (EST)   (19kb)';'   This is an overview of the problem of the vacuum in light-cone field theory, stressing its close connection to other puzzles regarding light-cone quantization. I explain the sense in which the light-cone vacuum is ``trivial,'' and describe a way of setting up a quantum field theory on null planes so that it is equivalent to the usual equal-time formulation. This construction is quite helpful in resolving the puzzling aspects of the light-cone formalism. It furthermore allows the extraction of effective Hamiltonians that incorporate vacuum physics, but that act in a Hilbert space in which the vacuum state is simple. The discussion is fairly informal, and focuses mainly on the conceptual issues. [Talk presented at {\sc Orbis Scientiae 1996}, Miami Beach, FL, January 25--28, 1996. To appear in the proceedings.] '
9603206;'Gauge Symmetry Breaking through Soft Masses in Supersymmetric Gauge';'Eric D'Hoker, Yukihiro Mimura, and Norisuke Sakai';'Sat, 30 Mar 1996 12:26:21 +0900   (32kb)';'   We analyze the effects of soft supersymmetry breaking terms on N=1 supersymmetric QCD with $N_f$ flavors and color gauge group $SU(N_c)$. The mass squared of some squarks may be negative, as long as vacuum stability is ensured by a simple mass inequality. For $N_f<N_c$, we include the dynamics of the non-perturbative superpotential and use the original (s)quark and gauge fields, while for $N_f>N_c+1$, we formulate the dynamics in terms of dual (s)quarks and a dual gauge group $SU(N_f-N_c)$. The presence of negative squark mass squared terms leads to spontaneous breakdown of flavor and color symmetry. We determine this breaking pattern, derive the spectrum, and argue that the masses vary smoothly as one crosses from the Higgs phase into the confining phase. '

Joshi';'Wed, 1 May 1996 15:22:16 +1000   (7kb)';'   The violation of the Jacobi identity by the presence of magnetic charge is accomodated by using an explicitly nonassociative theory of octonionic fields. It is found that the dynamics of this theory is simplified if the Lagrangian contains only dyonic charges, but certain problems in the constrained quantisation remain. The extension of these concepts to string theory may however resolve these difficulties. '
9605201;'Six-Dimensional Tensionless Strings In The Large N Limit';'Ori J. Ganor';'Wed, 29 May 1996 00:07:35 -0400   (33kb)';'   When $N$ five-branes of M-theory coincide the world-volume theory contains tensionless strings, according to Strominger's construction. This suggests a large $N$ limit of tensionless string theories. For the small $E_8$ instanton theories, the definition would be a large instanton number. An adiabatic argument suggests that in the large $N$ limit an effective extra uncompactified dimension might be observed. We also propose ``surface-equations'', which are an analog of Makeenko-Migdal loop-equations, and might describe correlators in the tensionless string theories. In these equations, the anti-self-dual two forms of 6D and the tensionless strings enter on an equal footing. Addition of strings with CFTs on their world-sheet is analogous to addition of matter in 4D QCD. '

We also discuss the problem of quantising Nambu mechanics. '
9605204;'Generalized Fock Spaces, New Forms of Quantum Statistics and their';'A.K.Mishra and G.Rajasekaran (Institute of Mathematical Sciences)';'Wed, 29 May 1996 10:19:05 +0530 (GMT+05:30)   (47kb)';'   We formulate a theory of generalized Fock spaces which underlies the different forms of quantum statistics such as ``infinite'', Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics. Single-indexed systems as well as multi-indexed systems that cannot be mapped into single-indexed systems are studied. Our theory is based on a three-tiered structure consisting of Fock space, statistics and algebra. This general formalism not only unifies the various forms of statistics and algebras, but also allows us to construct many new forms of quantum statistics as well as many algebras of creation and destruction operators. Some of these are : new algebras for infinite statistics, q-statistics and its many avatars, a consistent algebra for fractional statistics, null statistics or statistics of frozen order, ``doubly-infinite'' statistics, many representations of orthostatistics, Hubbard statistics and its variations.

9605205;'A Hidden Connection between Lax Descriptions and Superextensions of KdV';'Wen-Jui Huang';'Wed, 29 May 1996 13:42:08 +0800   (9kb)';'   A previously unnoticed connection between the Lax descriptions and the superextensions of the KdV hierarchy is presented. It is shown that the two different Lax descriptions of the KdV hierarchy come out naturally from two different bihamiltonian superextensions of the KdV hierarchy. Some implications of this observation are briefly mentioned. '

They can be considered as computer algorithms, because the one-loop calculations are then reduced to the simplest algebraic operations. Some test applications are considered by REDUCE analytical calculation system. '
9605207;'Physical States and Gauge Independence of the Energy-Momentum Tensor in';'Taro Kashiwa and Naoki Tanimura (Department of Physics, Kyushu';'Wed, 29 May 1996 20:28:41 +0900   (70kb)';'   Discussions are made on the relationship between physical states and gauge independence in QED. As the first candidate take the LSZ-asymptotic states in a covariant canonical formalism to investigate gauge independence of the (Belinfante's) symmetric energy-momentum tensor. It is shown that expectation values of the energy-momentum tensor in terms of those asymptotic states are gauge independent to all orders. Second, consider gauge invariant operators of electron or photon, such as the Dirac's electron or Steinmann's covariant approach, expecting a gauge invariant result without any restriction. It is, however, demonstrated that to single out gauge invariant quantities is merely synonymous to a gauge fixing, resulting again in use of the asymptotic condition when proving gauge independence. Nevertheless, it is commented that these invariant approaches is helpful to understand the mechanism of the LSZ-mapping and furthermore of quark confinement in QCD. As the final candidate, it is shown that gauge transformations are freely performed under the functional representation or the path integral expression on account of the fact that the functional space is equivalent to a collection of infinitely many inequivalent Fock spaces. The covariant LSZ formalism is shortly reviewed and the basic facts on the energy-momentum tensor are also illustrated. '

This result is related to the symmetries of the self-dual Yang--Mills equations. '
9605209;'Quantum Fields in Hyperbolic Space-Times with Finite Spatial Volume';'A.A. Bytsenko, Guido Cognola and Sergio Zerbini';'Wed, 29 May 1996 15:33:35 +0200   (17kb)';'   The one-loop effective action for a massive self-interacting scalar field is investigated in $4$-dimensional ultrastatic space-time $ R \times H^3/\Gamma$, $H^3/\Gamma$ being a non-compact hyperbolic manifold with finite volume. Making use of the Selberg trace formula, the $\zeta$-function related to the small disturbance operator is constructed. For an arbitrary gravitational coupling, it is found that $\zeta(s)$ has a simple pole at $s=0$. The one-loop effective action is analysed by means of proper-time regularisations and the one-loop divergences are explicitly found. It is pointed out that, in this special case, also $\zeta$-function regularisation requires a divergent counterterm, which however is not necessary in the free massless conformal invariant coupling case. Finite temperature effects are studied and the high-temperature expansion is presented. A possible application to the problem of the divergences of the entanglement entropy for a free massless scalar field in a Rindler-like space-time is briefly discussed. '

This approach has a number of unique features that make it particularly appealing, most notably, the ground state of the free theory is also a ground state of the full theory. '

Nanopoulos';'Wed, 29 May 1996 23:52:22 +0100   (20kb)';'   Within a Liouville approach to non-critical string theory, we discuss space-time foam effects on the propagation of low-energy particles. We find an induced frequency-dependent dispersion in the propagation of a wave packet, and observe that this would affect the outcome of measurements involving low-energy particles as probes. In particular, the maximum possible order of magnitude of the space-time foam effects would give rise to an error in the measurement of distance comparable to that independently obtained in some recent heuristic quantum-gravity analyses. We also briefly compare these error estimates with the precision of astrophysical measurements. '

The non-Abelian T-duality relates $\sigma$-models living on the cosets of a Drinfeld double with respect to its isotropic subgroups. The role of the Abelian momentum-winding lattice is in general played by the fundamental group of the Drinfeld double. '
9605213;'Higher-order simple Lie algebras';'J. A. de Azcarraga and J. C. Perez Bueno';'Thu, 30 May 1996 10:22:33 METDST   (17kb)';'   It is shown that the non-trivial cocycles on simple Lie algebras may be used to introduce antisymmetric multibrackets which lead to higher-order Lie algebras, the definition of which is given. Their generalised Jacobi identities turn out to be satisfied by the antisymmetric tensors (or higher-order `structure constants') which characterise the Lie algebra cocycles. This analysis allows us to present a classification of the higher-order simple Lie algebras as well as a constructive procedure for them. Our results are synthesised by the introduction of a single, complete BRST operator associated with each simple algebra. '

These black holes can be described as intersections of ten--dimensional non-singular Ramond-Ramond objects, i.e.~$D$-branes, waves and Taub-NUT solitons. Using this description it can be shown that the four--dimensional black holes decompactify near the core to higher--dimensional {\em non-singular} solutions. In terms of these higher--dimensional non-singular solutions we define a non-vanishing entropy for all four black hole types from a four--dimensional point of view. '

We find a universal ratio between the reflection amplitudes for particles that are related by supersymmetry and we propose exact reflection matrices for the supersymmetric extensions of the multi-component Yang-Lee models and for the breather multiplets of the supersymmetric sine-Gordon theory. We point out the connection between our reflection matrices and the classical boundary actions for the supersymmetric sine-Gordon theory as constructed by Inami, Odake and Zhang \cite{IOZ}. '

Taormina (Durham University)';'Thu, 30 May 96 18:15:37 BST   (30kb)';'   N=2 noncritical strings are closely related to the $\Slr/\Slr$ Wess-Zumino- Novikov-Witten model, and there is much hope to further probe the former by using the algebraic apparatus provided by the latter. An important ingredient is the precise knowledge of the $\hslc$ representation theory at fractional level. In this paper, the embedding diagrams of singular vectors appearing in $\hslc$ Verma modules for fractional values of the level ($k=p/q-1$, p and q coprime) are derived analytically. The nilpotency of the fermionic generators in $\hslc$ requires the introduction of a nontrivial generalisation of the MFF construction to relate singular vectors among themselves. The diagrams reveal a striking similarity with the degenerate representations of the $N=2$ superconformal algebra. '

We study a variety of such singularities and give a procedure for resolving those which can be cured perturbatively. Among the novel features which emerge are models in which smoothing singularities in the base yields a gauge {\it sheaf}\/ as opposed to a gauge bundle as the structure to which left moving fermions couple. Supersymmetric $\sigma$-models with target data being an appropriate sheaf on a Calabi-Yau space therefore appear to be the natural arena for N=1 string models in four dimensions. We also indicate a variety of singularities which would require a nonperturbative treatment for their resolution and briefly discuss applications to heterotic models on K3. '

In the fermionic description of the internal sector supersymmetry is realized quantum mechanically, so that both tree-level and one-loop effects contribute to the order ${\cal{O}}({\alpha'}^0)$ constraints. We also discuss the physical interpretation of the resulting target space geometry in terms of configurations of a $2+2$-dimensional object propagating in a $10+2$-dimensional spacetime with a null isometry, which has recently been suggested as a unified description of string and M theory.

They describe six dimensional extremal black strings with traveling waves and have an inhomogeneous distribution of momentum along the string. The structure of these solutions near the horizon is studied and the horizon area computed. We also count the number of BPS string states at weak coupling whose macroscopic momentum distribution agrees with that of the black string. It is shown that the number of such states is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black string with traveling waves. '
9605225;'Gravitational Quantum Cohomology';'Tohru Eguchi, Kentaro Hori and Chuan-Sheng Xiong';'Fri, 31 May 1996 11:42:12 +0900   (33kb)';'   We discuss how the theory of quantum cohomology may be generalized to ``gravitational quantum cohomology'' by studying topological sigma models coupled to two-dimensional gravity. We first consider sigma models defined on a general Fano manifold $M$ (manifold with a positive first Chern class) and derive new recursion relations for its two point functions. We then derive bi-Hamiltonian structures of the theories and show that they are completely integrable at least at the level of genus $0$. We next consider the subspace of the phase space where only a marginal perturbation (with a parameter $t$) is turned on and construct Lax operators (superpotentials) $L$ whose residue integrals reproduce correlation functions. In the case of $M=CP^N$ the Lax operator is given by $L= Z_1+Z_2+\cdots +Z_N+e^tZ_1^{-1}Z_2^{-1}\cdots Z_N^{-1}$ and agrees with the potential of the affine Toda theory of the $A_N$ type. We also obtain Lax operators for various Fano manifolds; Grassmannians, rational surfaces etc. In these examples the number of variables of the Lax operators is the same as the dimension of the original manifold. Our result shows that Fano manifolds exhibit a new type of mirror phenomenon where mirror partner is a non-compact Calabi-Yau manifold of the type of an algebraic torus $C^{*N}$ equipped with a specific superpotential.

9605226;'Spin of Chern-Simons vortices';'R. Banerjee and P. Mukherjee';'Fri, 31 May 96 16:16:41+050   (8kb)';'   We discuss a novel method of obtaining the fractional spin of abelian and nonabelian Chern-Simons vortices. This spin is interpreted as the difference between the angular momentum obtained by modifying Schwinger's energy momentum tensor by the Gauss constraint, and the canonical (Noether) angular momentum. It is found to be a boundary term depending only on the gauge field and, hence, is independent of the matter sector to which the Chern-Simons term couples. Addition of the Maxwell term does not alter the fractional spin. '
9605228;'Quantization of $gl(1,{\bf R})$ Generalized Chern-Simons Theory in 1+1';'Noboru Kawamoto, Eisaku Ozawa and Kazuhiko Suehiro';'Mon, 3 Jun 96 13:22:55 JST   (11kb)';'   We present a quantization of previously proposed generalized Chern-Simons theory with $gl(1,{\bf R})$ algebra in 1+1 dimensions. This simplest model shares the common features of generalized CS theories: on-shell reducibility and violations of regularity. On-shell reducibility of the theory requires us to use the Lagrangian Batalin-Vilkovisky and/or Hamiltonian Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky formulation. Since the regularity condition is violated, their quantization is not straightforward. In the present case we can show that both formulations give an equivalent result. It leads to an interpretation that a physical degree of freedom which does not exist at the classical level appears at the quantum level. '
9605229;'Massive and massless monopoles with nonabelian magnetic charges';'Kimyeong Lee, Erick J. Weinberg, Piljin Yi';'Fri, 31 May 96 17:46:39 GMT   (41kb)';'   We use the multimonopole moduli space as a tool for studying the properties of BPS monopoles carrying nonabelian magnetic charges. For configurations whose total magnetic charge is purely abelian, the moduli space for nonabelian breaking can be obtained as a smooth limit of that for a purely abelian breaking. As the asymptotic Higgs field is varied toward one of the special values for which the unbroken symmetry is enlarged to a nonabelian group, some of the fundamental monopoles of unit topological charge remain massive but acquire nonabelian magnetic charges. The BPS mass formula indicates that others should become massless in this limit. We find that these do not correspond to distinct solitons but instead manifest themselves as ``nonabelian clouds'' surrounding the massive monopoles. The moduli space coordinates describing the position and $U(1)$ phase of these massless monopoles are transformed into an equal number of nonabelian global gauge orientation and gauge-invariant structure parameters characterizing the nonabelian cloud. We illustrate this explicitly in a class of $Sp(2N)$ examples for which the full family of monopole solutions is known. We show in detail how the unbroken symmetries of the theory are manifested as isometries of the moduli space metric. We discuss the connection of these results to the Montonen-Olive duality conjecture, arguing in particular that the massless monopoles should be understood as the duals to the massless gauge bosons that appear as the mediators of the nonabelian forces in the perturbative sector.

9605231;'Analytic Treatment of Positronium Spin Splittings in Light-Front QED';'Billy D. Jones (1), Robert J. Perry (1), Stanislaw D. Glazek (2) ((1)';'Sat, 01 Jun 96 08:22:45 -0400   (39kb)';'   We study the QED bound-state problem in a light-front hamiltonian approach. Starting with a bare cutoff QED Hamiltonian, $H_{_{B}}$, with matrix elements between free states of drastically different energies removed, we perform a similarity transformation that removes the matrix elements between free states with energy differences between the bare cutoff, $\Lambda$, and effective cutoff, $\lam$ ($\lam < \Lam$). This generates effective interactions in the renormalized Hamiltonian, $H_{_{R}}$. These effective interactions are derived to order $\alpha$ in this work, with $\alpha \ll 1$. $H_{_{R}}$ is renormalized by requiring it to satisfy coupling coherence. A nonrelativistic limit of the theory is taken, and the resulting Hamiltonian is studied using bound-state perturbation theory (BSPT). The effective cutoff, $\lam^2$, is fixed, and the limit, $0 \longleftarrow m^2 \alpha^2\ll \lam^2 \ll m^2 \alpha \longrightarrow \infty$, is taken. This upper bound on $\lam^2$ places the effects of low-energy (energy transfer below $\lam$) emission in the effective interactions in the $| e {\overline e} > $ sector. This lower bound on $\lam^2$ insures that the nonperturbative scale of interest is not removed by the similarity transformation. As an explicit example of the general formalism introduced, we show that the Hamiltonian renormalized to $O(\alpha)$ reproduces the exact spectrum of spin splittings, with degeneracies dictated by rotational symmetry, for the ground state through $O(\alpha^4)$. The entire calculation is performed analytically, and gives the well known singlet-triplet ground state spin splitting of positronium, $7/6 \alpha^2 Ryd$. We discuss remaining corrections other than the spin splittings and how they can be treated in calculating the spectrum with higher precision. '

We add a superpotential that has the form of Arnold's $D$ series $W = \Tr X^{k+1} + \Tr XY^2$. We present a dual description in terms of an $SU(3kN_f - N_c)$ gauge theory, and we show that the duality passes many tests. At the end of the paper, we show how a deformation of this superpotential flows to another duality having a product gauge group $SU(N_c)\times SU(N_c')$, with an adjoint field charged under $SU(N_c)$, an adjoint field charged under $SU(N_c')$, fields in the $(N_c,N_c')$ and $(\overline N_c,\overline N_c')$ representation, and a number of fundamentals. The dual description is an $SU(2kN_f' + kN_f - N_c')\times SU(2kN_f + kN_f' - N_c)$ gauge theory. '

Wadia';'Mon, 3 Jun 96 9:47:10 IST   (13kb)';'   Classically a black hole can absorb but not emit energy. We discuss how this T-asymmetric property of black holes arises in the recently proposed (T-symmetric) microscopic models of black holes based on bound states of D-branes. In these string theory based models, the nonvanishing classical absorption is made possible essentially by the exponentially increasing degeneracy of quantum states with mass of the black hole. The classical limit of the absorption crosssection computed in the microscopic model agrees with the result obtained from a classical analysis of a wave propagating in the background metric of the corresponding black hole (upto a numerical factor).

We reproduce the excitation spectrum and $S$-matrix of the fusion RSOS models in the regime III and show that their correlation functions and form factors can be expressed in terms of those of the ordinary (ABF) RSOS models.

9605236;'More on Four-Dimensional Extremal Black Holes';'N. Hambli';'Sun, 2 Jun 1996 18:49:23 -0400 (EDT)   (12kb)';'   We consider an embedding of the extremal four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole into type $IIB$ string theory. The equivalent type $IIB$ configuration, in the D-brane weak-coupling picture, is a bound state of D1- and D5-branes threaded by fundamental type $IIB$ strings. The bound state involves also a NSNS solitonic 5-brane, mimicking the role of the Kaluza-Klein magnetic monopole. The statistical entropy derived by counting the degeneracy of the BPS-saturated excitations of this bound state agrees perfectly with the (semiclassical) Bekenstein-Hawking formula. '
9607201;'Lectures on Superstring and M Theory Dualities';'John H.

Next they review recently discovered dualities that relate all five of the 10d superstring theories and a quantum extension of 11d supergravity called M theory. The study of p-branes of various dimensions (some of which are D-branes) plays a central role. The final sections survey supersymmetric string vacua in 6d and some of the dual constructions by which they can be obtained. Special emphasis is given to a class of N=1 models that exhibit ``heterotic-heterotic duality.'' '

We realize the N=2 supersymmetry algebra as actions on the superinstanton moduli. This allows us to recast in concise superfield notation our previously obtained expression for the exact classical interaction between n ADHM superinstantons mediated by the adjoint Higgs bosons, and moreover, to incorporate N_F flavors of hypermultiplets. We perform explicit 1- and 2-instanton checks of the Seiberg-Witten prepotentials for all N_F and arbitrary hypermultiplet masses. Our results for the low-energy couplings are all in precise agreement with the predictions of Seiberg and Witten except for N_F=4, where we find a finite renormalization of the coupling which is absent in the proposed solution.

Sfetsos';'Fri, 26 Jul 1996 07:57:02 MDT   (20kb)';'   The presence of Killing-Yano tensors implies the existence of non-standard supersymmetries in point particle theories on curved backgrounds. In a string theoretical context these are symmetries of the modes describing the particle-like behavior of the string. In the presence of isometries we show that, in addition to these, one can also define a new type of non-standard supersymmetry among a mixture of particle and winding modes. The interplay with T-duality is also examined and illustrated by explicit examples. '

9607206;'Quantum Topological Invariants, Gravitational Instantons and the';'Damiano Anselmi (Harvard University)';'Sat, 27 Jul 96 16:48:27 -0400   (20kb)';'   Certain topological invariants of the moduli space of gravitational instantons are defined and studied. Several amplitudes of two and four dimensional topological gravity are computed. A notion of puncture in four dimensions, that is particularly meaningful in the class of Weyl instantons, is introduced. The topological embedding, a theoretical framework for constructing physical amplitudes that are well-defined order by order in perturbation theory around instantons, is explicitly applied to the computation of the correlation functions of Dirac fermions in a punctured gravitational background, as well as to the most general QED and QCD amplitude. Various alternatives are worked out, discussed and compared. The quantum background affects the propagation by generating a certain effective ``quantum'' metric. The topological embedding could represent a new chapter of quantum field theory. '

Seiberg';'Sat, 27 Jul 1996 23:48:41 -0400   (12kb)';'   We discuss non-trivial fixed points of the renormalization group with dual descriptions in $N=4$ gauge theories in three dimensions. This new duality acts as mirror symmetry, exchanging the Higgs and Coulomb branches of the theories. Quantum effects on the Coulomb branch arise classically on the Higgs branch of the dual theory. We present examples of dual theories whose Higgs/Coulomb branch are the ALE spaces and whose Coulomb/Higgs branches are the moduli space of instantons of the corresponding $ADE$ gauge group. In particular, we show that in three dimensions small $E_8$ instantons in string theory are described by a local quantum field theory. '

It is explicitly shown that Chern-Simons field theory is finite at the two-loop level. This finiteness plays an important role in the relation of Chern-Simons theory with two-dimensional conformal field theory and the description of link invariant. '

For F=6 we solve the theory exactly in terms of confined degrees of freedom and a superpotential. By adding mass terms we obtain the theories with F<6 which we find to exhibit a host of interesting non-perturbative phenomena: quantum deformed moduli spaces with N constraints, instanton-induced superpotentials and non-equivalent disjoint branches of moduli spaces. We find a simple dual for F=8 and no superpotential. We show how the F=4 and F=2 theories can be modified to break supersymmetry spontaneously and point out that the Sp(6) theory with F=6 may be very interesting for model builders. '

9607215;'Higher Loop Anomalies and their Consistency Conditions in Nonlocal';'Jordi Par\'{\i}s and Walter Troost';'Mon, 29 Jul 96 11:00:17 CET   (43kb)';'   An algebraic program of computation and characterization of higher loop BRST anomalies is presented. We propose a procedure for disentangling a genuine{\it local} higher loop anomaly from the quantum dressings of lower loop anomalies. For such higher loop anomalies we derive a local consistency condition, which is the generalisation of the Wess-Zumino condition for the one-loop anomaly. The development is presented in the framework of the field-antifield formalism, making use of a nonlocal regularization method. The theoretical construction is exemplified by explicitly computing the two-loop anomaly of chiral $W_3$ gravity. We also give, for the first time, an explicit check of the local two--loop consistency condition that is associated with this anomaly. '

It is shown how to construct the complete expansion of the hypermultiplet with respect to the central charge.

This model corresponds to finite quantum field theory and does not demand the regularization and renormalization at effective action calculation. It is shown that in local approximation the effective action is defined by two objects called general superfield effective lagrangian and chiral superfield effective lagrangian. A proper-time method is generalized for calculation of these two effective lagrangians in superfield manner. Power expansion of the effective action in supercovariant derivatives is formulated and the lower terms of such an expansion are calculated in explicit superfield form. '
9607218;'T-Duality Transformation and Universal Structure of Non-Critical String';'Takashi Asatani, Tsunehide Kuroki, Yuji Okawa, Fumihiko Sugino and';'Tue, 30 Jul 96 11:14:59 +0900   (76kb)';'   We discuss a T-duality transformation for the c=1/2 matrix model for the purpose of studying duality transformations in a possible toy example of nonperturbative frameworks of string theory. Our approach is to first investigate the scaling limit of the Schwinger-Dyson equations and the stochastic Hamiltonian in terms of the dual variables and then compare the results with those using the original spin variables. It is shown that the c=1/2 model in the scaling limit is T-duality symmetric in the sphere approximation. The duality symmetry is however violated when the higher-genus effects are taken into account, owing to the existence of global Z_2 vector fields corresponding to nontrivial homology cycles. Some universal properties of the stochastic Hamiltonians which play an important role in discussing the scaling limit and have been discussed in a previous work by the last two authors are refined in both the original and dual formulations. We also report a number of new explicit results for various amplitudes containing macroscopic loop operators. '

In particular, the quantum moduli space of vacua of $N=2$ SUSY $SU(3)$ gauge theories coupled to two flavors of massless quarks in the fundamental representation can be related to the spectral curve of the Goryachev-Chaplygin top. Generalizing this to the cases with {\it massive} quarks, and $N_f = 0,1,2$, we find a corresponding integrable system in seven dimensional phase space where a hyperelliptic curve appears in the Painlev\'e test. To understand the stringy origin of the integrability of these theories we obtain exact nonperturbative point particle limit of type II string compactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold, which gives the hyperelliptic curve of $SU(2)$ QCD with $N_f =1$ hypermultiplet.

As a corollary we gain insight into the (in general non-trivial) topology of the reduced phase space.  The classification covers basically all 2D metrics of Lorentzian signature with a (local) Killing symmetry. '

Brax (DAMTP-University of Cambridge-UK)';'Tue, 30 Jul 1996 15:29:11 +0100   (7kb)';'   We study the three dimensional Navier-Stokes equation with a random Gaussian force acting on large wavelengths. Our work has been inspired by Polyakov's analysis of steady states of two dimensional turbulence. We investigate the time evolution of the probability law of the velocity potential. Assuming that this probability law is initially defined by a statistical field theory in the basin of attraction of a renormalisation fixed point, we show that its time evolution is obtained by averaging over small scale features of the velocity potential. The probability law of the velocity potential converges to the fixed point in the long time regime. At the fixed point, the scaling dimension of the velocity potential is determined to be ${-{4\over 3}}$. We give conditions for the existence of such a fixed point of the renormalisation group describing the long time behaviour of the velocity potential. At this fixed point, the energy spectrum of three dimensional turbulence coincides with a Kolmogorov spectrum. '
9607232;'Tachyons and the preferred frames';'Jakub Rembielinski (Lodz University, Poland)';'Tue, 30 Jul 1996 18:16:36 EDT   (28kb)';'   Quantum field theory of space-like particles is investigated in the framework of absolute causality scheme preserving Lorentz symmetry. It is related to an appropriate choice of the synchronization procedure (definition of time). In this formulation existence of field excitations (tachyons) distinguishes an inertial frame (privileged frame of reference) via spontaneous breaking of the so called synchronization group. In this scheme relativity principle is broken but Lorentz symmetry is exactly preserved in agreement with local properties of the observed world. It is shown that tachyons are associated with unitary orbits of Poincar\'e mappings induced from $SO(2)$ little group instead of $SO(2,1)$ one. Therefore the corresponding elementary states are labelled by helicity. The cases of the helicity $\lambda = 0$ and $\lambda = \pm\frac{1}{2}$ are investigated in detail and a corresponding consistent field theory is proposed. In particular, it is shown that the Dirac-like equation proposed by Chodos et al., inconsistent in the standard formulation of QFT, can be consistently quantized in the presented framework. This allows us to treat more seriously possibility that neutrinos might be fermionic tachyons as it is suggested by experimental data about neutrino masses. '

Pacheva';'Tue, 30 Jul 1996 17:42:03 -0600   (62kb)';'   This paper provides a systematic description of the interplay between a specific class of reductions denoted as \cKPrm ($r,m \geq 1$) of the primary continuum integrable system -- the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili ({\sf KP}) hierarchy and discrete multi-matrix models. The relevant integrable \cKPrm structure is a generalization of the familiar $r$-reduction of the full {\sf KP} hierarchy to the $SL(r)$ generalized KdV hierarchy ${\sf cKP}_{r,0}$. The important feature of \cKPrm hierarchies is the presence of a discrete symmetry structure generated by successive Darboux-B\"{a}cklund (DB) transformations. This symmetry allows for expressing the relevant tau-functions as Wronskians within a formalism which realizes the tau-functions as DB orbits of simple initial solutions. In particular, it is shown that any DB orbit of a ${\sf cKP}_{r,1}$ defines a generalized 2-dimensional Toda lattice structure. Furthermore, we consider the class of truncated {\sf KP} hierarchies ({\sl i.e.}, those defined via Wilson-Sato dressing operator with a finite truncated pseudo-differential series) and establish explicitly their close relationship with DB orbits of \cKPrm hierarchies. This construction is relevant for finding partition functions of the discrete multi-matrix models.   The next important step involves the reformulation of the familiar non-isospectral additional symmetries of the full {\sf KP} hierarchy so that their action on \cKPrm hierarchies becomes consistent with the constraints of the reduction. Moreover, we show that the correct modified additional symmetries are compatible with the discrete DB symmetry on the \cKPrm DB orbits.   The above technical arsenal is subsequently applied to obtain complete '
9607235;'Black Holes in String Theory';'Juan M. Maldacena';'Tue, 30 Jul 1996 22:36:30 -0400   (71kb)';'   This thesis is devoted to trying to find a microscopic quantum description of black holes. We consider black holes in string theory which is a quantum theory of gravity. We find that the ``area law'' black hole entropy for extremal and near-extremal charged black holes arises from counting microscopic configurations. We study black holes in five and four spacetime dimensions. We calculate the Hawking temperature and give a physical picture of the Hawking decay process. Hopefully, the reader will find here a moderately self contained review of D-branes and string theory applied to black hole physics. '
9607236;'Bubbles in Kaluza-Klein theories with space- or time-like internal';'A. Chamblin (Institute for Theoretical Physics, UCSB), R. Emparan';'Tue, 30 Jul 1996 20:12:15 -0700   (25kb)';'   Bubbles are point-like regular solutions of the higher-dimensional Kaluza-Klein equations that appear as naked singularities in four dimensions. We analyze all such possible solutions in 5D Kaluza-Klein theory that are static and spherically symmetric. We show that they can be obtained by taking unusual choices of the parameters in the dyonic black hole solutions, and find that regularity can only be achieved if their electric charge is zero. However, they can be neutral or possess magnetic charge. We study some of their properties, both in theories where the internal dimension is space-like as well as time-like. Since bubbles do not have horizons, they have no entropy, nor do they emit any thermal radiation, but they are, in general, non-extremal objects. In the two-timing case, it is remarkable that non-singular massless monopoles are possible, probably signaling a new pathology of these theories. These two-timing monopoles connect two asymptotically flat regions, and matter can flow from one region to the other. We also present a C-type solution that describes neutral bubbles in uniform acceleration, and we use it to construct an instanton that mediates the breaking of a cosmic string by forming bubbles at its ends. The rate for this process is also calculated. Finally, we argue that a similar solution can be constructed for magnetic bubbles, and that it can be used to describe a semiclassical instability of the two-timing vacuum against production of massless monopole pairs.

9607237;'Grand Unification in Non-Associative Geometry';'Raimar Wulkenhaar';'Wed, 31 Jul 96 12:54:43 -0000   (69kb)';'   We formulate the flipped SU(5) x U(1)-GUT within the framework of non-associative geometry. It suffices to take the matrix Lie algebra su(5) as the input; the u(1)-part with its representation on the fermions is an algebraic consequence. The occurring Higgs multiplets (24,5,45,50-representations of su(5)) are uniquely determined by the fermionic mass matrix and the spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern to SU(3) x U(1). We find the most general gauge invariant Higgs potential that is compatible with the given Higgs vacuum. Our formalism yields tree-level predictions for the masses of all gauge and Higgs bosons. It turns out that the low-energy sector is identical with the standard model. In particular, there exists precisely one light Higgs field, whose upper bound for the mass is 1.45 m_t. All remaining 207 Higgs fields are extremely heavy. '

This form of the Ward Identities is applied to spontaneously broken N=2 Yang-Mills theory and used to derive a condition on the low energy effective action. This condition is satisfied by the solution proposed by Seiberg and Witten. '

Abramov';'Wed, 31 Jul 1996 17:25:57 +0300 (EET DST)   (9kb)';'   We define and study the ternary analogues of Clifford algebras. It is proved that the ternary Clifford algebra with $N$ generators is isomorphic to the subalgebra of the elements of grade zero of the ternary Clifford algebra with $N+1$ generators. In the case $N=3$ the ternary commutator of cubic matrices induced by the ternary commutator of the elements of grade zero is derived. We apply the ternary Clifford algebra with one generator to construct the $Z_3$-graded generalization of the simplest algebra of supersymmetries. '

The modified model is equivalent to the derivative nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger model which does not possess parity and Galilean invariance. We obtain explicit one and two classical soliton solutions and show that in the weak coupling limit, they correctly reproduce the bound state energy as well as the time delay of two-body quantum mechanics of the model.

We study their coupling to 2-dim gravity in the conformal gauge and show that the resulting models can be interpreted as conformal non-Abelian Toda theories when a certain algebraic condition is satisfied. These models, however, do not provide quantum mechanically consistent string backgrounds in the case the underlying WZW constraints are first solved classically. '
9609201;'Negative modes around Einstein-Yang-Mills sphalerons and black holes';'Mikhail S.Volkov';'Wed, 25 Sep 96 16:39:03 +0200   (34kb)';'   The dynamics of small perturbations around sphaleron and black hole solutions in the Einstein-Yang-Mills theory for the gauge group $SU(2)$ is investigated. The perturbations can be split into the two independent sectors in accordance with their parity; each sector contains negative modes. The even-parity negative modes are shown to correspond to the negative second variations of the height of the potential energy barrier near the sphaleron. For the odd-parity sector, the existence of precisely $n$ (the number of nodes of the sphaleron solution gauge field function) negative modes is rigorously proven. The same results hold for the Einstein-Yang-Mills black holes as well. '

Schaposnik';'Wed, 25 Sep 96 12:49:32-030   (14kb)';'   We discuss non-Abelian bosonization of two and three dimensional fermions using a path-integral framework in which the bosonic action follows from the evaluation of the fermion determinant for the Dirac operator in the presence of a vector field. This naturally leads to the Wess-Zumino-Witten action for massless two-dimensional fermions and to a Chern-Simons action for very massive three dimensional fermions. One advantage of our approach is that it allows to derive the exact bosonization recipe for fermion currents in a systematic way. '

Slupinski';'Wed, 25 Sep 1996 18:48:04 METDST   (17kb)';'   Non-trivial extensions of the three dimensional Poincar\'e algebra, beyond the supersymmetric one, are explicitly constructed. These algebraic structures are the natural three dimensional generalizations of fractional supersymmetry of order $F$ already considered in one and two dimensions. Representations of these algebras are exhibited, and unitarity is explicitly checked. It is then shown that these extensions generate symmetries which connect fractional spin states or anyons. Finally, a natural classification arises according to the decomposition of $F$ into its product of prime numbers leading to sub-systems with smaller symmetries. '

The three-dimensional case is analyzed explicitly, and it is proved to be anomaly free. Moreover, at the second order in perturbation theory, a new formula for the second coefficient of the Alexander-Conway polynomial is obtained. An account on the higher-dimensional generalizations is also given. '
9609206;'The Luttinger-Schwinger Model';'H. Grosse, E. Langmann, E. Raschhofer';'Thu, 26 Sep 1996 09:30:19 +0200 (MET DST)   (20kb)';'   We study the Luttinger-Schwinger model, i.e. the (1+1) dimensional model of massless Dirac fermions with a non-local 4-point interaction coupled to a U(1)-gauge field. The complete solution of the model is found using the boson-fermion correspondence, and the formalism for calculating all gauge invariant Green functions is provided. We discuss the role of anomalies and show how the existence of large gauge transformations implies a fermion condensate in all physical states. The meaning of regularization and renormalization in our well-defined Hilbert space setting is discussed. We illustrate the latter by performing the limit to the Thirring-Schwinger model where the interaction becomes local. '
9609207;'Worldsheets with Extended Supersymmetry';'Laurent Baulieu and Nobuyoshi Ohta';'Thu, 26 Sep 1996 18:27:47 +0900   (14kb)';'   We determine the equations which govern the gauge symmetries of worldsheets with local supersymmetry of arbitrary rank $(N,N')$, and their possible anomalies. Both classical and ghost conformally invariant multiplets of the left or right sector are assembled into the components of a single $O(N)$-superfield. The component with ghost number zero of this superfield is the $N$-supersymmetric generalization of the Beltrami differential. In a Lagrangian approach, and after gauge-fixing, it becomes the super-moduli of Riemann surfaces coupled to local supersymmetry of rank $N$. It is also the source of all linear superconformal currents derived from ordinary operator product techniques. The interconnection between BRST invariant actions with different values of $N\geq 3$, and their possible link to topological 2D-gravity coupled to topological sigma models, are shown by straightforward algebraic considerations.

9609209;'Large radii and string unification';'I. Antoniadis and M. Quiros';'Thu, 26 Sep 1996 17:30:42 UTC+0100   (11kb)';'   We study strong coupling effects in four-dimensional heterotic string models where supersymmetry is spontaneously broken with large internal dimensions, consistently with perturbative unification of gauge couplings. These effects give rise to thresholds associated to the dual theories: type I superstring or M-theory. In the case of one large dimension, we find that these thresholds appear close to the field-theoretical unification scale $\sim 10^{16}$ GeV, offering an appealing scenario for unification of gravitational and gauge interactions. We also identify the inverse size of the eleventh dimension of M-theory with the energy at which four-fermion effective operators become important. '
9609210;'Nonperturbative Effects in Noncritical Strings with Soliton Backgrounds';'Masafumi Fukuma and Shigeaki Yahikozawa';'Fri, 27 Sep 1996 02:56:30 +0900   (16kb)';'   We explicitly construct soliton operators in $D<2$ (or $c<1$) string theory, and show that the Schwinger-Dyson equations allow solutions with these solitons as backgrounds. The dominant contributions from 1-soliton background are explicitly evaluated in the weak coupling limit, and shown to agree with the nonperturbative analysis of string equations. We suggest that fermions should be treated as fundamental dynamical variables since both macroscopic loops and solitons are constructed in their bilinear forms. '
9609211;'Anomaly cancellation in M-theory';'S.P. de Alwis';'Thu, 26 Sep 96 16:18:40 -0600   (5kb)';'   We show the complete cancellation of gauge and gravitational anomalies in the M-theory of Horava and Witten using their boundary contribution, and a term coming from the existence of two and five-branes. A factor of three discrepancy noted in an earlier work is resolved. We end with a comment on flux quantization. '
9609212;'No-force condition and BPS combinations of p-branes in 11 and 10';'A.A. Tseytlin';'Thu, 26 Sep 1996 23:04:03 +0100   (16kb)';'   The condition of vanishing of static force on a q-brane probe in the gravitational background produced by another p-brane is used to give a simple derivation of the pair-wise intersection rules which govern the construction of BPS combinations of branes. These rules, while implied also by supersymmetry considerations, thus have purely bosonic origin. Imposing the no-force requirement makes possible to add branes `one by one' to construct composite BPS configurations (with zero binding energy) of 2-branes and 5-branes in D=11 and of various p-branes in D=10. The advantage of this elementary approach is its universality, i.e. the cases of different dimensions and different types of branes (e.g., NS-NS, R-R and `mixed' combinations of NS-NS and R-R branes in D=10) are all treated in the same way.

Coupling the Toda equations and the string equations, we derive a special case of the Painlev\'{e} III equation. From the Virasoro constrains, we can use the radial coordinate. The relation between $t_{1}$ and $t_{-1}$ is like the complex conjugate. %An implicit to the $t\bar{t}$ fusion of topological sigma model %is therby expected. '

The authors use recently developed mathematical techniques in combination with a standard variational principle to formulate a new variational approach for matrix models. Approximate variational solutions of interacting large-N matrix models are found using the free random matrices as the variational space. Several classes of classical and quantum mechanical matrix models with different types of interactions are considered and the variational solutions compared with exact Monte Carlo and analytical results. Impressive agreement is found in a majority of cases. '

We consider the cases of the pure gauge theory as well as the theories with matter in the fundamental and in the adjoint representations. The pure theory as well as the one with adjoint hypermultiplet give rise to the known relativistic integrable systems with ${1\over{R}}$ playing the r\^ole of the speed of light.

We develop formalism where superstring amplitudes are computed via integration of some differential forms over a section of P over the super moduli space M. We show that the result of integration does not depend on the choice of section when all the states are BRST physical. Our approach is based on the geometrical theory of integration on supermanifolds of which we give a short review. '
9609221;'High energy scattering of non-critical strings';'Kenichiro Aoki, Eric D'Hoker';'Sat, 28 Sep 1996 10:47:16 +0900   (15kb)';'   We summarize recent work, in which we consider scattering amplitudes of non-critical strings in the limit where the energy of all external states is large compared to the string tension. We show that the high energy limit is dominated by a saddle point that can be mapped onto an electrostatic equilibrium configuration of an assembly of charges associated with the external states, together with a density of charges arising from the Liouville field. The Liouville charges accumulate on line segments, which produce quadratic branch cuts on the worldsheet. The electrostatics problem is solved for string tree level in terms of hyperelliptic integrals and is given explicitly for the 3- and 4-point functions. For generic values of the central charge, the high energy limit behaves in a string-like fashion, with exponential energy dependence. '

These equations admit an infinite number of inequivalent Lagrangian descriptions. A model for reparametrisation invariant membranes is obtained by reversing the roles of base and target space variables in these considerations. '

Tirkkonen';'Mon, 30 Sep 1996 12:23:36 GMT   (24kb)';'   We show that the problem of computing the vacuum expectation values of gauge invariant operators in the strong coupling limit of topologically massive gauge theory is equivalent to the problem of computing similar operators in the $G_k/G$ model where $k$ is the integer coefficient of the Chern-Simons term. The $G_k/G$ model is a topological field theory and many correlators can be computed analytically. We also show that the effective action for the Polyakov loop operator and static modes of the gauge fields of the strongly coupled theory at finite temperature is a perturbed, non-topological $G_k/G$ model. In this model, we compute the one loop effective potential for the Polyakov loop operators and explicitly construct the low-lying excited states. In the strong coupling limit the theory is in a deconfined phase. '

We then study the creation operators of states which respectively carry a point charge and a closed magnetic string in the electromagnetic language or a point topological charge and a closed Kalb-Ramond charged string in the Kalb-Ramond dual language. Their commutation relation is evaluated, implying they satisfy a dual algebra and their composite possesses generalized statistics. In the local limit where the radius of the string vanishes, only Fermi or Bose statistics are allowed. This provides an explicit operator realization for statistical transmutation in 3+1D. '

The differential equations are real, and are shown not to admit square-integrable real solutions (even when allowing non-vanishing boundary conditions at infinity). Complex solutions, however, are not excluded by this argument. '

Decay modes whose spin structures are incompatible with those of supersymmetric vacua have previously been constructed, and we present generalisations including those involving non trivial dilaton and antisymmetric tensor fields. We then show that the requirement that any instanton describing supersymmetric vacuum decay should admit both a zero momentum hypersurface from which we describe the subsequent Lorentzian evolution and a spin structure at infinity compatible with the putative vacuum excludes all such decay modes, except those with unphysical energy momentum tensors which violate the dominant energy condition.

We show that for various choices of the weights of vertices of the dynamical triangulation the model can be solved by resumming the Itzykson-Di Francesco formula over congruence classes of Young tableau weights modulo three. From this we show that the large-N limit implies a non-trivial correspondence with models of random surfaces weighted with only even coordination number vertices. We examine the critical behaviour and evaluation of observables and discuss their interrelationships in all models. We obtain explicit solutions of the model for simple choices of vertex weightings and use them to show how the matrix model reproduces features of the random surface sum. We also discuss some general properties of the large-N character expansion approach as well as potential physical applications of our results. '

Nanopoulos';'Mon, 30 Sep 96 14:28:04 -0500   (71kb)';'   We discuss the scattering of a light closed-string state off a $D$ brane, taking into account quantum recoil effects on the latter, which are described by a pair of logarithmic operators. The light-particle and $D$-brane subsystems may each be described by a world-sheet with an external source due to the interaction between them. This perturbs each subsystem away from criticality, which is compensated by dressing with a Liouville field whose zero mode we interpret as time. The resulting evolution equations for the $D$ brane and the closed string are of Fokker-Planck and modified quantum Liouville type, respectively. The apparent entropy of each subsystem increases as a result of the interaction between them, which we interpret as the loss of information resulting from non-observation of the other entangled subsystem. We speculate on the possible implications of these results for the propagation of closed strings through a dilute gas of virtual $D$ branes. '
9609239;'Geometric Engineering of Quantum Field Theories';'Sheldon Katz, Albrecht Klemm and Cumrun Vafa';'Mon, 30 Sep 96 17:35:17 -0400   (24kb)';'   Using the recent advances in our understanding of non-perturbative aspects of type II strings we show how non-trivial exact results for $N=2$ quantum field theories can be reduced to T-dualities of string theory. This is done by constructing a local geometric realization of quantum field theories together with a local application of mirror symmetry. This construction is not based on any duality conjecture and thus reduces non-trivial quantum field theory results to much better understood T-dualities of type II strings. Moreover it can be used in principle to construct in a systematic way the vacuum structure for arbitrary $N=2$ gauge theories with matter representations. '
9609240;'Two--Dimensional BF Model Quantized in the Axial Gauge';'S. Emery, M. Kr\"uger, J. Rant, M. Schweda, T. Sommer';'Tue, 1 Oct 96 0:10:31 METDST   (16kb)';'   The two--dimensional topological BF model is quantized in the axial gauge. We show that this theory is trivially ultraviolet finite and that the usual infrared problem of the propagator of the scalar field in two dimensions is replaced by an easily solvable long distances problem inherent to the axial gauge. It will also be shown that contrarily to the 3--dimensional case, the action principle cannot be completely replaced by the various Ward identities expressing the symmetries of the model; some of the equation of motion are needed.

9610201;'Conformal equivalence of 2D dilaton gravity models';'Mariano Cadoni';'Fri, 25 Oct 1996 14:39:46 +0200 (CET)   (11kb)';'   We investigate the behavior of generic, matter-coupled, 2D dilaton gravity theories under dilaton-dependent Weyl rescalings of the metric. We show that physical observables associated with 2D black holes, such as the mass, the temperature and the flux of Hawking radiation are invariant under the action of both Weyl transformations and dilaton reparametrizations. The field theoretical and geometrical meaning of these invariances is discussed. '
9610202;'A Quantum Gauge Group Approach to the 2D SU(n) WZNW Model';'Paolo Furlan, Ludmil K. Hadjiivanov and Ivan T. Todorov';'Fri, 25 Oct 1996 15:19:55 +0200 (MET DST)   (12kb)';'   The canonical quantization of the WZNW model provides a complete set of exchange relations in the enlarged chiral state spaces that include the Gauss components of the monodromy matrices. Regarded as new dynamical variables, the elements of the latter cannot be identified -- they satisfy different exchange relations. Accordingly, the two dimensional theory expressed in terms of the left and right movers' fields does not automatically respect monodromy invariance. Continuing our recent analysis of the problem by gauge theory methods we conclude that physical states (on which the two dimensional field acts as a single valued operator) are invariant under the (permuted) coproduct of the left and right $U_q(sl(n))$. They satisfy additional constraints fully described for n=2. '

The calculations follow an alternate approach, recently proposed as a gauge invariant formulation of the effective potential, constructed in terms of a gauge invariant order parameter. We compare the results with another investigation, obtained within a standard route of calculating the effective potential. '

We also introduce a nonchiral function K which is expressed in terms of the Seiberg-Witten and Poincare' metrics. It turns out that K has all the expected properties of the next to leading term in the Wilsonian effective action whose modular properties are considered in the framework of the dimensional regularization.

Some of these theories exhibit exotic global symmetries, including non-simply laced groups (such as $F_4$). They are obtained by studying threebrane probes in F-theory compactifications on elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds. The geometry of the compactification encodes in a simple way the behavior of the gauge coupling and the K\"ahler potential on the Coulomb branch of these theories. '

They become the multi-time Schroedinger equation for the nonstationary Hitchin system. From the known form of the equations we learn about the covariance of quantization with respect to changes of the coordinate frame. '

Due to the equivalence with the system of three reggeized gluons, the intercept of the odderon trajectory is predicted for the first time, as the analytic function of the two relevant parameters. '

We introduce a low energy, effective, Lagrangian which incorporates the remnants of a local quaternionic algebra, investigate the stellar production of the resultant exotic bosons and explore the possible low energy consequences of our remnant extended Hilbert space.

9610211;'On Instanton Calculations of N=2 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory';'Yuhsuke Yoshida';'Mon, 28 Oct 1996 18:40:01 +0900   (18kb)';'   Instanton calculations are demonstrated from a viewpoint of twisted topological field theory. Various properties become manifest such that perturbative corrections are terminated at one-loop, and norm cancellations occur between bosonic and fermionic excitations in any instanton background. We can easily observe that for a suitable choice of Green functions the infinite dimensional path integration reduces to a finite dimensional integration over a supersymmetric instanton moduli space.

The $\eta$ phase of the spectral flow is nicely incorporated through twisted fermions and the spectral flow resulting from the inner automorphism of the N=4 superconformal algebras is explicitly shown to be operating as identiy relations among the generators. Conditions for the unitary representations are also investigated in our Feigin-Fuks parameter space. '

Quandt';'Mon, 28 Oct 96 10:20:35 +0100   (101kb)';'   Yang-Mills theory is studied in a variant of 't Hooft's maximal Abelian gauge. In this gauge magnetic monopoles arise in the Abelian magnetic field. We show, however, that the full (non-Abelian) magnetic field does not possess any monopoles, but rather strings of magnetic fluxes. We argue that these strings are the relevant infrared degrees of freedom. The properties of the magnetic strings which arise from a dilute instanton gas are investigated for the gauge group SU(2). '

Ravishankar (Dept. of physics Indian Institute of';'Mon, 28 Oct 96 15:50:02 IST   (16kb)';'   We study the production and the equilibration of a non-Abelian $q\bar{q}$ plasma in an external chromoelectric field, by solving the Boltzmann equation with the non-Abelian features explicitly incorporated. We consider the gauge group $SU(2)$ and show that the colour degree of freedom has a major and dominant role in the dynamics of the system. It is seen that the assumption of the so called Abelian dominance is not justified. Finally, it is also shown that many of the features of microscopic studies of the system appear naturally in our studies as well. '

Quite remarkably, all their conservation laws can be written in closed form, which provides thus a simple constructive integrability proof. '

We thus show that their value is a "gauge" artifact indeed. We also show that previously computed values of these beta functions can be continuously connected to one another by smoothly varying those gauge parameters. '

We find that the original Aharonov-Bohm scattering amplitude satisfies the unitarity relation under the regularization prescription whose theoretical foundation does not appear to be understood. On the other hand, the amplitude obtained by Ruijsenaars who uses plane wave as incident wave also satisfies the unitarity relation but in an unusual way. '

9610221;'Symmetries of the stochastic Burgers equation';'E.V. Ivashkevich';'Mon, 28 Oct 1996 20:05:54 +0300   (9kb)';'   All Lie symmetries of the Burgers equation driven by an external random force are found. Besides the generalized Galilean transformations, this equation is also invariant under the time reparametrizations. It is shown that the Gaussian distribution of a pumping force is not invariant under the symmetries and breaks them down leading to the nontrivial vacuum (instanton). Integration over the volume of the symmetry groups provides the description of fluctuations around the instanton and leads to an exactly solvable quantum mechanical problem. '
9610222;'Symplectic Gravity Models in Four, Three and Two Dimensions';'O.Kechkin and M.Yurova';'Mon, 28 Oct 1996 16:21:44 +0300 (MSD )   (11kb)';'   A class of the $D=4$ gravity models describing a coupled system of $n$ Abelian vector fields and the symmetric $n \times n$ matrix generalizations of the dilaton and Kalb-Ramond fields is considered. It is shown that the Pecci-Quinn axion matrix can be entered and the resulting equations of motion possess the $Sp(2n, R)$ symmetry in four dimensions. The stationary case is studied. It is established that the theory allows a $\sigma$-model representation with a target space which is invariant under the $Sp[2(n+1), R]$ group of isometry transformations. The chiral matrix of the coset $Sp[2(n+1), R]/U(n+1)$ is constructed. A K\"ahler formalism based on the use of the Ernst $(n+1) \times (n+1)$ complex symmetric matrix is developed. The stationary axisymmetric case is considered. The Belinsky-Zakharov chiral matrix depending on the original field variables is obtained. The Kramer-Neugebauer transformation, which algebraically maps the original variables into the target space ones, is presented. '
9610223;'3D Ising Model:The Scaling Equation of State';'Riccardo Guida, Jean Zinn Justin';'Mon, 28 Oct 1996 21:00:58 +0100   (55kb)';'   The equation of state of the universality class of the 3D Ising model is determined numerically in the critical domain from quantum field theory and renormalization group techniques. The starting point is the five loop perturbative expansion of the effective potential (or free energy) in the framework of renormalized $\phi^4_3$ field theory. The 3D perturbative expansion is summed, using a Borel transformation and a mapping based on large order behaviour results. It is known that the equation of state has parametric representations which incorporate in a simple way its scaling and regularity properties. We show that such a representation can be used to accurately determine it from the knowledge of the few first coefficients of the expansion for small magnetization. Revised values of amplitude ratios are deduced. Finally we compare the 3D values with the results obtained by the same method from the $\epsilon=4-d$ expansion. '
9610224;'Structure constants for the osp(1|2) current algebra';'I. P. Ennes, A. V. Ramallo and J. M. Sanchez de Santos';'Mon, 28 Oct 1996 14:33:24 WST   (38kb)';'   We study the free field realization of the two-dimensional osp(1|2) current algebra. We consider the case in which the level of the affine osp(1|2) symmetry is a positive integer. Using the Coulomb gas technique we obtain integral representations for the conformal blocks of the model. In particular, from the behaviour of the four-point function, we extract the structure constants for the product of two arbitrary primary operators of the theory. From this result we derive the fusion rules of the osp(1|2) conformal field theory and we explore the connections between the osp(1|2) affine symmetry and the N=1 superconformal field theories. '
9610225;'A Large N Chiral Transition on a Plaquette';'Shailesh Chandrasekharan';'Mon, 28 Oct 1996 15:34:47 -0500   (14kb)';'   We construct a model of a chiral transition using the well known large N transition in two dimensional U(N) lattice gauge theory. Restricting the model to a single plaquette, we introduce Grassmann variables on the corners of the plaquette with the natural phase factors of staggered fermions and couple them to the U(N) link variables. The classical theory has a continuous chiral symmetry which is broken at strong couplings, but is restored for weak couplings in the $N \to \infty$ limit. '
9610226;'Super-Maxwell Actions with Manifest Duality';'Nathan Berkovits';'Mon, 28 Oct 1996 21:01:22 -0200   (6kb)';'   Superstring field theory was recently used to derive a four-dimensional Maxwell action with manifest duality. This action is related to the McClain-Wu-Yu Hamiltonian and can be locally coupled to electric and magnetic sources.   In this letter, the manifestly dual Maxwell action is supersymmetrized using N=1 and N=2 superspace. The N=2 version may be useful for studying Seiberg-Witten duality. '

The superconformal improvement requires adding another supermultiplet beginning with the U(1)_{R} current. We determine the anomalous (quantum mechanical) supersymmetry transformation associated with the central charge and the energy-momentum tensor to one-loop order. '
9610229;'Zeta-function on the generalised cone';'Guido Cognola and Sergio Zerbini';'Tue, 29 Oct 1996 11:01:27 +0100   (8kb)';'   The analytic properties of the zeta-function for a Laplace operator on a generalised cone are studied in some detail using the Cheeger's approach and explicit expressions are given. In the compact case, the zeta-function of the Laplace operator turns out to be singular at the origin. As a result, strictly speaking, the zeta-function regularisation does not ``regularise'' and a further subtraction is required for the related one-loop effective potential. '

We outline the framework of quantum deformations of D=4 space-time symmetries with dimensionfull deformation parameter, and present some recent results. '
9610231;'The Number of Particles Released in Gauge Cosmic String Formation';'Bj{\o}rn Jensen';'Tue, 29 Oct 1996 15:04:16 +0100 (MET)   (9kb)';'   We give a simple derivation of a new formal expression for the number of particles produced from a conformal scalar field vacuum due to the creation of a gauge cosmic string. We find that the number of particles released in string formation may be substantially lower than what previous estimates have indicated. Our derivation also indicates that there always exists at least one critical angle deficit less than $2\pi$, at which the particle production attains a maximum value. At the end we argue that additional (quantum) effects will occur in string formation. In particular, a new mechanism to produce small scale structure on strings is proposed. '
9610232;'Quantum corrections for D=4 black holes and D=5 strings';'Klaus Behrndt';'Tue, 29 Oct 1996 17:41:45 +0100 (MET)   (11kb)';'   In recent times quantum corrections for N=2 black holes in 4 dimensions have been addressed in the framework of double extreme black hole solutions, which are characterised by constant scalar fields. In this paper we generalize these solutions to non-constant scalar fields. This enables us to discuss quantum corrections for massless black holes and for configurations that are classically singular. We also discuss the relation to the 5-dimensional magnetic string solution. '

Matinyan and Berndt M\"uller';'Tue, 29 Oct 1996 14:39:48 -0500 (EST)   (20kb)';'   We discuss the intimate connection between the chaotic dynamics of a classical field theory and the instability of the one-loop effective action of the associated quantum field theory. Using the example of massless scalar electrodynamics, we show how the radiatively induced spontaneous symmetry breaking stabilizes the vacuum state against chaos, and we speculate that monopole condensation can have the same effect in non-Abelian gauge theories.

9610234;'Five-Brane Effective Action In M-Theory';'Edward Witten';'Tue, 29 Oct 1996 17:03:47 EST   (33kb)';'   On the world-volume of an $M$-theory five-brane propagates a two-form with self-dual field strength. As this field is non-Lagrangian, there is no obvious framework for determining its partition function. An analogous problem exists in Type IIB superstring theory for the self-dual five-form. The resolution of these problems and definition of the partition function is explained. A more complete analysis of perturbative anomaly cancellation for $M$-theory five-branes is also presented, uncovering some surprising details. '
9610235;'Properties of Supermembrane Axions';'F. Aldabe';'Tue, 29 Oct 1996 18:01:03 -0700 (MST)   (33kb)';'   In the presence of membranes, M-theory becomes in the low energy limit 11 dimensional supergravity action coupled to a supermembrane action. The fields of the first action are the same fields which couple to the membrane. It is shown that the axionic moduli of the membrane obtained by wrapping the three form potential about three-cycles of a Calabi-Yau manifold can take nonzero integer values. This novel property allows M-theory to have smooth transition from the Kahler cone of a geometrical phase to a Kahler cone of another geometrical phase. Nongeometrical phases which define the boundary of the extended Kahler cone of the geometrical phases have discrete spectrum, and are continuously connected to the geometric phases. Using this new property, we relate the M-theory model dependent axion to the type IIA model dependent axion and show that a potential develops for the type IIA axion in the strong coupling regime which does not seem to be generated by instantons. Evidence is presented, using these moduli, which supports the Strominger conjecture on the winding p-branes. '

We argue that they have the correct long-range fields and spectrum of excitations. We prove Dirac charge quantization with the membrane by showing that the five-brane induces a Berry phase in the membrane world-volume theory, with a familiar magnetic monopole form. '

The latter is an infinite sum of gravitational instanton effects which we associate with the effects of Euclidean fivebranes wrapped on $T^6$. These fivebranes are the neutral fivebranes or zero size instantons of heterotic string theory. '
9610238;'String and M-Theory Cosmological Solutions with Ramond Forms';'Andre Lukas, Burt A. Ovrut, Daniel Waldram';'Tue, 29 Oct 1996 21:36:47 -0500 (EST)   (38kb)';'   A general framework for studying a large class of cosmological solutions of the low-energy limit of type II string theory and of M-theory, with non-trivial Ramond form fields excited, is presented. The framework is applicable to spacetimes decomposable into a set of flat or, more generally, maximally symmetric spatial subspaces, with multiple non-trivial form fields spanning one or more of the subspaces. It is shown that the corresponding low-energy equations of motion are equivalent to those describing a particle moving in a moduli space consisting of the scale factors of the subspaces together with the dilaton. The choice of which form fields are excited controls the potential term in the particle equations. Two classes of exact solutions are given, those corresponding to exciting only a single form and those with multiple forms excited which correspond to Toda theories. Although typically these solutions begin or end in a curvature singularity, there is a subclass with positive spatial curvature which appears to be singularity free. Elements of this class are directly related to certain black p-brane solutions. '
9610240;'Gauge Independent Reduction of a Solvable Model with Gribov-Like';'R. Banerjee';'Wed, 30 Oct 1996 12:19:11 -0200   (17kb)';'   We present a gauge independent Lagrangian method of abstracting the reduced space of a solvable model with Gribov-like ambiguity, recently proposed by Friedberg, Lee, Pang and Ren. The reduced space is found to agree with the explicit solutions obtained by these authors. Complications related to gauge fixing are analysed. The Gribov ambiguity manifests by a nonuniqueness in the canonical transformations mapping the hamiltonian in the afflicted gauge with that obtained gauge independently. The operator ordering problem in this gauge is investigated and a prescription is suggested so that the results coincide with the usual hamiltonian formalism using the Schr\"odinger representation. Finally, a Dirac analysis of the model is elaborated. In this treatment it is shown how the existence of a nontrivial canonical set in the ambiguity-ridden gauge yields the connection with the previous hamiltonian formalism. '
9610241;'Finite Temperature Schwinger Model with Chirality Breaking Boundary';'Stephan D\"urr and Andreas Wipf';'Wed, 30 Oct 96 15:59:25 MET   (24kb)';'   The $N_f$-flavour Schwinger Model on a finite space $0\leq x^1\leq L$ and subject to bag-type boundary-conditions at $x^1=0$ und $x^1=L$ is solved at finite temperature $T=1/\beta$. The boundary conditions depend on a real parameter $\theta$ and break the axial flavour symmetry. We argue that this approach is more appropriate to study the broken phases than introducing small quark masses, since all calculations can be performed analytically. In the imaginary time formalism we determine the thermal correlators for the fermion-fields and the determinant of the Dirac-operator in arbitrary background gauge-fields. We show that the boundary conditions induce a CP-odd $\theta$-term in the effective action. The chiral condensate, and in particular its T- and L- dependence, is calculated for $N_f$ fermions. It is seen to depend on the order in which the two lengths $\beta=1/T$ and $L$ are sent to infinity. '
9610242;'Non-perturbative Quantum Theories and Integrable Equations';'A. Marshakov';'Wed, 30 Oct 1996 18:28:06 +0300 (MSK)   (38kb)';'   I review the appearance of classical integrable systems as an effective tool for the description of non-perturbative exact results in quantum string and gauge theories. Various aspects of this relation: spectral curves, action-angle variables, Whitham deformations and associativity equations are considered separately demonstrating hidden parallels between topological 2d string theories and naively non-topological 4d theories. The proofs are supplemented by explicit illustrative examples. '
9610243;'Null Strings in Schwarzschild Spacetime';'Mariusz P. Dabrowski and Arne. L. Larsen';'Thu, 31 Oct 1996 12:57:29 +0100 (MEZ)   (10kb)';'   The null string equations of motion and constraints in the Schwarzschild spacetime are given. The solutions are those of the null geodesics of General Relativity appended by a null string constraint in which the "constants of motion" depend on the world-sheet spatial coordinate. Because of the extended nature of a string, the physical interpretation of the solutions is completely different from the point particle case. In particular, a null string is generally not propagating in a plane through the origin, although each of its individual points is. Some special solutions are obtained and their physical interpretation is given. Especially, the solution for a null string with a constant radial coordinate $r$ moving vertically from the south pole to the north pole around the photon sphere, is presented. A general discussion of classical null/tensile strings as compared to massless/massive particles is given. For instance, tensile circular solutions with a constant radial coordinate $r$ do not exist at all. The results are discussed in relation to the previous literature on the subject. '
9610244;'Dynamical Gauge Boson and Strong-Weak Reciprocity';'M. Bando, Y. Taniguchi and S. Tanimura';'Thu, 31 Oct 1996 22:15:17 +0900   (27kb)';'   It is proposed that asymptotically nonfree gauge theories are consistently interpreted as theories of composite gauge bosons. It is argued that when hidden local symmetry is introduced, masslessness and coupling universality of dynamically generated gauge boson are ensured. To illustrate these ideas we take a four dimensional Grassmannian sigma model as an example and show that the model should be regarded as a cut-off theory and there is a critical coupling at which the hidden local symmetry is restored. Propagator and vertex functions of the gauge field are calculated explicitly and existence of the massless pole is shown. The beta function determined from the $ Z $ factor of the dynamically generated gauge boson coincides with that of an asymptotic nonfree elementary gauge theory. Using these theoretical machinery we construct a model in which asymptotic free and nonfree gauge bosons coexist and their running couplings are related by the reciprocally proportional relation. '

J. da Silva';'Thu, 31 Oct 1996 16:51:59 -0200 (EDT)   (29kb)';'   We study the nonrelativistic limit of the quantum theory of a real scalar field with quartic self-interaction. The two body scattering amplitude is written in such way as to separate the contributions of high and low energy intermediary states. From this result and the two loop computation of the self energy correction, we determine an effective nonrelativistic action. '

Schwarz';'Thu, 31 Oct 1996 13:42:32 -0800   (8kb)';'   We formulate world-volume actions that describe the dynamics of Dirichlet p-branes in a flat 10d background. The fields in these theories consist of the 10d superspace coordinates and an abelian world-volume gauge field. The global symmetries are given by the N=2A or N=2B super-Poincare group, according to whether p is even or odd. The local symmetries in the (p + 1)-dimensional world volume are general coordinate invariance and a fermionic kappa symmetry. '
9610250;'Perturbative Dynamics of Fractional Strings on Multiply Wound D-strings';'Akikazu Hashimoto';'Thu, 31 Oct 1996 16:35:48 -0500   (15kb)';'   Fractional strings in the spectrum of states of open strings attached to a multiply wound D-brane is explained. We first describe the fractional string states in the low-energy effective theory where the topology of multiple winding is encoded in the gauge holonomy. The holonomy induces twisted boundary conditions responsible for the fractional moding of these states. We also describe fractional strings in world sheet formulation and compute simple scattering amplitudes for Hawking emission/absorption. Generalization to fractional DN-strings in a 1-brane 5-brane bound state is described. When a 1-brane and a 5-brane wraps $Q_1$ and $Q_5$ times respectively around a circle, the momentum of DN-strings is quantized in units of $2 \pi/L Q_1 Q_5$. These fractional states appear naturally in the perturbative spectrum of the theory. '
9610251;'Branes, Calabi-Yau Spaces, and Toroidal Compactification of the N=1';'Ori J. Ganor, David R. Morrison, Nathan Seiberg';'Thu, 31 Oct 1996 14:59:56 MST   (37kb)';'   We consider compactifications of the N=1, d=6, E_8 theory on tori to five, four, and three dimensions and learn about some properties of this theory. As a by-product we derive the SL(2,\IZ) duality of the N=2, d=4, SU(2) theory with N_f=4. Using this theory on a D-brane probe we shed new light on the singularities of F-theory compactifications to eight dimensions. As another application we consider compactifications of F-theory, M-theory and the IIA string on (singular) Calabi-Yau spaces where our theory appears in spacetime. Our viewpoint leads to a new perspective on the nature of the singularities in the moduli space and their spacetime interpretations. In particular, we have a universal understanding of how the singularities in the classical moduli space of Calabi--Yau spaces are modified by worldsheet instantons to singularities in the moduli space of the corresponding conformal field theories.

9610252;'Resolution of Cosmological Singularities';'Finn Larsen and Frank Wilczek';'Thu, 31 Oct 1996 17:27:46 -0500   (10kb)';'   We show that a class of 3+1 dimensional Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmologies can be embedded within a variety of solutions of string theory. In some realizations the apparent singularities associated with the big bang or big crunch are resolved at non-singular horizons of higher-dimensional quasi-black hole solutions (with compactified real time); in others plausibly they are resolved at D-brane bound states having no conventional space-time interpretation.

9611201;'M-Theory Origin of Mirror Symmetry in Three Dimensional Gauge Theories';'M. Porrati, A. Zaffaroni';'Sun, 24 Nov 96 14:45:20 EST   (15kb)';'   We present M-theory compactifications on $K_3 \times K_3$ with membranes near the $A_n$ or $D_n$ singularities of the $K_3$ spaces. By realizing each of these compactifications in two different ways as type I' models with 2- and 6-branes, we explain the three-dimensional duality between gauge theories recently found by Intriligator and Seiberg. We also find new pairs of dual gauge theories, which we briefly describe. '
9611202;'Branes, Fluxes and Duality in M(atrix)-Theory';'Ori J. Ganor, Sanjaye Ramgoolam and Washington Taylor IV';'Sun, 24 Nov 1996 18:44:44 -0500   (15kb)';'   We use the T-duality transformation which relates M-theory on T^3 to M-theory on a second T^3 with inverse volume to test the Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind suggestion for the matrix model description of M-theory. We find evidence that T-duality is realized as S-duality for $U(\infty)$ N=4 Super-Yang-Mills in 3+1D. We argue that Kaluza Klein states of gravitons correspond to electric fluxes, wrapped membranes become magnetic fluxes and instantonic membranes are related to Yang-Mills instantons. The T-duality transformation of gravitons into wrapped membranes is interpreted as the duality between electric and magnetic fluxes. The identification of M-theory T-duality as SYM S-duality provides a natural framework for studying the M-theory 5-brane as the S-dual object to the unwrapped membrane. Using the equivalence between compactified M(atrix) theory and SYM, we find a natural candidate for a description of the light-cone 5-brane of M-theory directly in terms of matrix variables, analogous to the known description of the M(atrix) theory membrane.

Ovrut, Daniel Waldram';'Sun, 24 Nov 1996 17:14:12 -0500 (EST)   (25kb)';'   We show how non-trivial form fields can induce an effective potential for the dilaton and metric moduli in compactifications of type II string theory and M-theory. For particular configurations, the potential can have a stable minimum. In cosmological compactifications of type II theories, we demonstrate that, if the metric moduli become fixed, this mechanism can then lead to the stabilization of the dilaton vacuum. Furthermore, we show that for certain cosmological M-theory solutions, non-trivial forms lead to the stabilization of moduli. We present a number of examples, including cosmological solutions with two solitonic forms and examples corresponding to the infinite throat of certain p-branes. '

We give a simple argument why only short BPS multiplets contribute to these terms at one loop, and verify heterotic-type-I duality to this order. '
9611206;'Reply to Comment on ``Spinning Cosmic Strings and Quantization of';'Pawel O. Mazur';'Sun, 24 Nov 1996 22:31:22 -0500 (EST)   (3kb)';'   Quantum mechanics of a test particle interacting with a spinning string (torsion vortex) is the quantum mechanics of the celebrated Aharonov-Bohm effect. The angular momentum per unit length $J$ characterizing the spinning string corresponds to the magnetic flux $\Phi$ of the Aharonov-Bom fluxon and the gravitational mass-energy $E$ of an incoming particle corresponds to the electric charge $q$. The characteristic periodicity of the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm scattering cross-section in the product of $GEJ$ has suggested a new quantization of mass-energy relation. We encounter a new physical situation where the gravitational mass-energy is quantized and the quantization condition contains both the Newton constant $G$ and the Planck constant $h$. '

The models may serve as a nonperturbative regularization for the T-duality symmetry in continuum string theory. In particular, it now becomes possible to extract winding modes explicitly in terms of extended matrix variables. '

Ketov (ITP, University of Hannover)';'Mon, 25 Nov 1996 14:08:35 +0100 (MET)   (61kb)';'   An elementary introduction into the Seiberg-Witten theory is given. Many efforts are made to get it as pedagogical as possible, within a reasonable size. The selection of the relevant material is heavily oriented towards graduate students. The basic ideas about solitons, monopoles, supersymmetry and duality are reviewed from first principles, and they are illustrated on the simplest examples. The exact Seiberg-Witten solution to the low-energy effective action of the four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric pure Yang-Mills theory with the gauge group SU(2) is the main subject of the review. Other gauge groups are also considered. Some related issues (like adding matter, confinement, string dualities) are outlined. '

Sabra';'Mon, 25 Nov 1996 16:32:50 +0100   (8kb)';'   We discuss the entropy and the transformation properties of classical extremal N=2 black hole solutions in supergravity theories associated with the minimal coupling models CP(n-1,1). The entropy is given by a manifestly invariant quantity under the embedding of the duality group SU(1,n) into Sp(2n+2) which is a symmetry of the classical BPS mass formula. '
9611211;'Dirac Quantization of the Chern-Simons Field Theory in the Coulomb Gauge';'Franco Ferrari and Ignazio Lazzizzera';'Mon, 25 Nov 1996 16:59:14 +0100 (MET)   (10kb)';'   In this letter the Chern-Simons field theories are studied in the Coulomb gauge using the Dirac's canonical formalism for constrained systems. As a strategy, we first work out the constraints and then quantize, replacing the Dirac brackets with quantum commutators. We find that the Chern-Simons field theories become two dimensional models with no propagation along the time direction. Moreover, we prove that, despite of the presence of non-trivial self-interactions in the gauge fixed functional, the commutation relations between the fields are trivial at any order in perturbation theory in the absence of couplings with matter fields. If these couplings are present, instead, the commutation relations become rather involved, but it is still possible to study their main properties and to show that they vanish at the tree level. '
9611212;'On the Difference between Admissible and "Differentiable" Hamiltonians';'Vladimir O. Soloviev';'Mon, 25 Nov 1996 20:41:53 GMT+03:00   (14kb)';'   It is shown that the Regge-Teitelboim criterion for fixing the unique boundary contribution to the Hamiltonian compatible with free boundary conditions should be modified if the Poisson structure is noncanonical. The new criterion requires cancellation of boundary contributions to the Hamiltonian equations of motion. In the same time, boundary contributions to the variation of Hamiltonian are allowed. The Ashtekar formalism for gravity and hydrodynamics of the ideal fluid with a free surface in the Clebsch variables are treated as examples. '
9611213;'Dynamical Compactification as a Mechanism of Spontaneous Supersymmetry';'G. Dvali and M. Shifman';'Mon, 25 Nov 1996 19:48:04 +0100 (CET)   (21kb)';'   Supersymmetry breaking and compactification of extra space-time dimensions may have a common dynamical origin if our universe is spontaneously generated in the form of a four-dimensional topological or non-topological defect in higher dimensional space-time. Within such an approach the conventional particles are zero modes trapped in the core of the defect. In many cases solutions of this type spontaneously break all supersymmetries of the original theory, so that the low-energy observer from ``our'' universe inside the core would not detect supersymmetry. Since the extra dimensions are not compact but, rather, inaccessible to low-energy observers, the usual infinite tower of the Kaluza-Klein excitations does not exist. Production of superpartners at the energy scale of SUSY restoration will be accompanied by four-momentum non-conservation. (Depending on the nature of the solution at hand, the non-conservation may either happen above some threshold energy or be continuous). In either case, the door to extra dimensions may be not very far from the energies accessible at present colliders. '
9611214;'Scattering of Strings from D-branes';'Akikazu Hashimoto and Igor Klebanov';'Mon, 25 Nov 1996 17:05:26 -0500   (27kb)';'   We review a number of perturbative calculations describing the interactions of D-branes with massless elementary string states. The form factors for the scattering of closed strings off D-branes are closely related to the Veneziano amplitude. They show that, in interactions with strings, D-branes acquire many of their physical features: the effective size of D-branes is of order the string scale and expands with the energy of the probe, while the fixed angle scattering amplitudes fall off exponentially. We also calculate the leading process responsible for the absorption of closed strings: the amplitude for a closed string to turn into a pair of open strings attached to the D-brane. The inverse of this process describes the Hawking radiation by an excited D-brane. '
9611215;'Membrane Dynamics in M(atrix) Theory';'Ofer Aharony and Micha Berkooz (Rutgers University)';'Mon, 25 Nov 1996 18:55:57 -0500   (18kb)';'   We analyze some of the kinematical and dynamical properties of flat infinite membrane solutions in the conjectured M theory proposed by Banks, Fischler, Shenker and Susskind. In particular, we compute the long range potential between membranes and anti-membranes, and between membranes and gravitons, and compare it with the supergravity results. We also discuss membranes with finite relative longitudinal velocities, providing some evidence for the eleven dimensional Lorentz invariance of the theory. '

Determinant representation permit to describe correlation functions by classical completely integrable differential equations [Barough, McCoy, Wu]. In this paper we show that determinant represents works not only for free fermionic models. We obtained determinant representation for the correlation function $<\psi(0,0)\psi^\dagger(x,t)>$ of the quantum nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, out of free fermionic point. In the forthcoming publications we shall derive completely integrable equation and asymptotic for the quantum correlation function of this model of interacting fermions. '

We point out the existence of higher energy states interpret them as resonances of Skyrmions and anti-Skyrmions and study their decays. Most of the discussion involves a highly exited Skyrmion-like state with winding number one which decays into an ordinary Skyrmion and a Skyrmion-anti-Skyrmion pair. We also study wave-like solutions of the model and show that some of such solutions can be constructed from the solutions of the sine-Gordon equation. We also show that the baby-Skyrmion has non-topological stationary solutions. We study their interactions with Skyrmions. '
9611218;'On the Eleventh Dimension of String Theory';'Noureddine Mohammedi (Tours University)';'Tue, 26 Nov 96 18:23:34 +0000   (8kb)';'   An explanation of the origin of the hidden eleventh dimension in string theory is given. It is shown that any two sigma models describing the propagation of string backgrounds are related to each other by a Weyl transformation of the world-sheet metric. To avoid this ambiguity in defining two-dimensional sigma models, extra fields are needed. An interesting connection is established with Abelian T-duality. '
9611219;'A Quantum Model of Schwarzschild Black Hole Evaporation';'J. Cruz, A. Mikovic and J. Navarro-Salas';'Tue, 26 Nov 1996 15:22:27 MET   (13kb)';'   We construct a one-loop effective metric describing the evaporation phase of a Schwarzschild black hole in a spherically symmetric null-dust model. This is achieved by quantising the Vaidya solution and by chosing a time dependent quantum state. This state describes a black hole which is initially in thermal equilibrium and then the equilibrium is switched off, so that the black hole starts to evaporate, shrinking to a zero radius in a finite proper time. The naked singularity appears, and the Hawking flux diverges at the end-point. However, a static metric can be imposed in the future of the end-point. Although this end-state metric cannot be determined within our construction, we show that it cannot be a flat metric. '
9611220;'Multibracket simple Lie algebras';'J. A. de Azcarraga and J. C.

Their `structure constants' are given by Lie algebra cohomology cocycles which, by virtue of being such, satisfy a suitable generalization of the Jacobi identity. Finally, we introduce a nilpotent, complete BRST operator associated with the l multibracket algebras which are based on a given simple Lie algebra of rank l. '

The corresponding `Jacobi identities' are given by the vanishing of the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket. As an example, we provide the linear generalized Poisson structures which can be constructed on the dual spaces of simple Lie algebras. '

One configuration involves several parallel 3-brane probes in F-theory compactified on $T^4/Z_2$, while the other involves a compactification of F-theory on $T^6/Z_2 x Z_2$ (which includes intersecting $D_4$ singularities). In both cases string theory provides simple pictures of the spacetime theory, whose implications for the three-brane world-volume theories are discussed. In the second case the field theory on the probe is an unusual N=1 superconformal theory, with exact electric-magnetic duality. Several open questions remain concerning the description of this theory. '
9611223;'Early Universe Evolution in Graviton-Dilaton Models';'S. Kalyana Rama';'Wed, 27 Nov 1996 14:33:55 +0500   (26kb)';'   We present a class of graviton-dilaton models which leads to a singularity free evolution of the universe. We study the evolution of a homogeneous isotropic universe. We follow an approach which enables us to analyse the evolution and obtain its generic features even in the absence of explicit solutions, which are not possible in general. We describe the generic evolution of the universe and show, in particular, that it is singularity free in the present class of models. Such models may stand on their own as interesting models for singularity free cosmology, and may be studied accordingly. They may also arise from string theory. We discuss critically a few such possibilities. '

We show that in the perturbative expansion of the Green functions there are neither ultraviolet not infrared divergences. Moreover, all the radiative corrections are zero at any loop order. Some problems connected with the Coulomb gauge fixing, like the appearance of spurious singularities in the computation of the Feynman diagrams, are discussed and solved. The regularization used here for the spurious singularities can be easily applied also to the Yang-Mills case, which is affected by similar divergences. '

This allows us to construct the representations of osp(2,2) in terms of matrix differential operators in two variables. The corresponding operators provide the building blocks for the construction of quasi exactly solvable systems of two and four equations in two variables. Some generalisations are also sketched. The peculiar labelling used for the generators allows us to elaborate a nice deformation of osp(2,2). This gives an appropriate basis for analyzing the quasi exactly solvable systems of finite difference equations. '
9611228;'The Monopole Dominance in QCD';'Sergei V. Shabanov';'Wed, 27 Nov 1996 16:57:45 +0100 (MET)   (15kb)';'   A projection (gauge) independent formulation of the monopole dominance, discovered in lattice QCD for the maximal abelian projection, is given. A new dynamical abelian projection of continuum QCD, which does not rely on any explicit gauge condition imposed on gauge fields, is proposed. Under the assumption that the results of numerical simulations holds in the continuum limit, the monopole dominance is proved for the dynamical abelian projection. The latter enables us to develop an effective scalar field theory for dominant (monopole) configurations of gauge fields. The approach is manifestly gauge and Lorentz invariant. '
9611230;'Type IIB Superstrings, BPS Monopoles, And Three-Dimensional Gauge';'Amihay Hanany and Edward Witten';'Wed, 27 Nov 1996 18:49:54 -0500 (EST)   (64kb)';'   We propose an explanation via string theory of the correspondence between the Coulomb branch of certain three-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories and certain moduli spaces of magnetic monopoles. The same construction also gives an explanation, via $SL(2,\Z)$ duality of Type IIB superstrings, of the recently discovered ``mirror symmetry'' in three dimensions. New phase transitions in three dimensions as well as new infrared fixed points and even new coupling constants not present in the known Lagrangians are predicted from the string theory construction. An important role in the construction is played by a novel aspect of brane dynamics in which a third brane is created when two branes cross. '
9611231;'Intertwiners in Orbifold Conformal Field Theories';'P.S. Montague';'Wed, 27 Nov 1996 18:26:11 MST   (18kb)';'   Following on from earlier work relating modules of meromorphic bosonic conformal field theories to states representing solutions of certain simple equations inside the theories, we show, in the context of orbifold theories, that the intertwiners between twisted sectors are unique and described explicitly in terms of the states corresponding to the relevant modules. No explicit knowledge of the structure of the twisted sectors is required. Further, we propose a general set of sufficiency conditions, illustrated in the context of a third order no-fixed-point twist of a lattice theory, for verifying consistency of arbitrary orbifold models in terms of the states representing the twisted sectors.

9611233;'Noncommutative Geometry and D-Branes';'Pei-Ming Ho, Yong-Shi Wu';'Thu, 28 Nov 1996 04:58:23 -0700   (13kb)';'   We apply noncommutative geometry to a system of N parallel D-branes, which is interpreted as a quantum space. The Dirac operator defining the quantum differential calculus is identified to be the supercharge for strings connecting D-branes. As a result of the calculus, Connes' Yang-Mills action functional on the quantum space reproduces the dimensionally reduced U(N) super Yang-Mills action as the low energy effective action for D-brane dynamics. Several features that may look ad hoc in a noncommutative geometric construction are shown to have very natural physical or geometric origin in the D-brane picture in superstring theory. '

9611235;'Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theories in 1 + 1 Dimensions';'N. Sakai';'Thu, 28 Nov 1996 21:53:14 +0900   (27kb)';'   Supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories are considered in 1+1 dimensions. Firstly physical mass spectra of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories in 1+1 dimensions are evaluated in the light-cone gauge with a compact spatial dimension. The supercharges are constructed in order to provide a manifestly supersymmetric infrared regularization for the discretized light-cone approach. By exactly diagonalizing the supercharge matrix between up to several hundred color singlet bound states, we find a rapidly increasing density of states as mass increases. Interpreting this limiting density of states as the stringbehavior, we obtain the Hagedron temperature $\beta_H=0.676 \sqrt{\pi \over g^2 N}$. Secondly we have examined the vacuum structure of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories in 1+1 dimensions. SUSY allows only periodic boundary conditions for both fermions and bosons. By using the Born-Oppenheimer approximation for the weak coupling limit, we find that the vacuum energy vanishes, and hence the SUSY is unbroken. Other boundary conditions are also studied. The first part is based on a work in collaboration with Y. Matsumura and T. Sakai. The second part is based on a work in collaboration with H. Oda and T. Sakai. '

For both the groups the problem is reduced to the evaluation of an integral which is invariant under rotation for SU(2) and Lorentz transformation for SU(1,1). The integrals are accordingly evaluated by applying a rotation to a unit position vector in SU(2) and a Lorentz transformation to a unit SO(2,1) vector which is time-like for the elliptic elements and space-like for the hyperbolic elements in SU(1,1). The details of the procedure for the principal series of representations of SU(1,1) differ substantially from those of the discrete series.  '
9611237;'Decompactification near the horizon and non-vanishing entropy';'Klaus Behrndt';'Thu, 28 Nov 1996 20:53:36 +0100 (MET)   (8kb)';'   Intersecting D-brane configurations are related to black holes in D=4. Using the standard way of compactification only the Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m black hole is non-singular. In this paper we argue, that also the other black holes are non-singular if i) we compactify over a periodic array and ii) we allow the string metric after reaching a critical curvature to choose the dual geometry. Effectively this means that near the horizon the solution completely decompactifies and chooses a non-singular D-brane configuration. '

Zamolodchikov';'Thu, 28 Nov 1996 19:08:33 -0500   (18kb)';'   We propose an explicit expression for vacuum expectation values of the exponential fields in the sine-Gordon model. Our expression agrees both with semi-classical results in the sine-Gordon theory and with perturbative calculations in the Massive Thirring model. We use this expression to make new predictions about the large-distance asymptotic form of the two-point correlation function in the XXZ spin chain. '
9612201;'Field condensations and Noncritical String for c>1';'Kazuo Ghoroku';'Thu, 19 Dec 96 12:43:22 +0900   (15kb)';'   Quantum theory of 2d gravity for $c>1$ is examined as a non-critical string theory by taking account of the loop-correction of open strings whose end points are on the 2d world surface of the closed string. This loop-correction leads to a conformal anomaly, and we obtain a modified target-space action which implies a new phase of the non-critical closed-string. In this phase, the dual field of the gauge field, which lives on the boundary, condenses and the theory can be extended to $c>1$ without any instability. '
9612202;'Solvable Lie Algebras in Type IIA, Type IIB and M Theories';'L. Andrianopoli, R. D'Auria, S. Ferrara, P. Fr\'e, R. Minasian and M.';'Thu, 19 Dec 1996 16:09:28 GMT+1   (34kb)';'   We study some applications of solvable Lie algebras in type IIA, type IIB and M theories. RR and NS generators find a natural geometric interpretation in this framework. Special emphasis is given to the counting of the abelian nilpotent ideals (translational symmetries of the scalar manifolds) in arbitrary D dimensions. These are seen to be related, using Dynkin diagram techniques, to one-form counting in D+1 dimensions. A recipy for gauging isometries in this framework is also presented. In particular, we list the gauge groups both for compact and translational isometries. The former agree with some results already existing in gauged supergravity. The latter should be possibly related to the study of partial supersymmetry breaking, as suggested by a similar role played by solvable Lie algebras in N=2 gauged supergravity. '
9612203;'Chern-Simons Couplings and Inequivalent Vector-Tensor Multiplets';'P. Claus, B. de Wit, M. Faux and P. Termonia';'Thu, 19 Dec 1996 16:30:54 +0100 (MET)   (21kb)';'   The off-shell vector-tensor multiplet is considered in an arbitrary background of N=2 vector supermultiplets. We establish the existence of two inequivalent versions, characterized by different Chern-Simons couplings. In one version the vector field of the vector-tensor multiplet is contained quadratically in the Chern-Simons term, which implies nonlinear terms in the supersymmetry transformations and equations of motion. In the second version, which requires a background of at least two abelian vector supermultiplets, the supersymmetry transformations remain at most linear in the vector-tensor components. This version is of the type known to arise from reduction of tensor supermultiplets in six dimensions. Our work applies to any number of vector-tensor multiplets. '
9612204;'Superstring dualities and p-brane bound states';'M.S. Costa and G. Papadopoulos';'Thu, 19 Dec 96 15:57:58 GMT   (14kb)';'   We show that the M-theory/IIA and IIA/IIB superstring dualities together with the diffeomorphism invariance of the underlying theories require the presence of certain p-brane bound states in IIA and IIB superstring theories preserving 1/2 of the spacetime supersymmetry. We then confirm the existence of IIA and IIB supergravity solutions having the appropriate p-brane bound states interpretation. '
9612205;'Supersymmetric quantum theory and (non-commutative) differential';'J. Froehlich, O. Grandjean, A. Recknagel (ETH Zuerich)';'Thu, 19 Dec 1996 17:43:00 +0100 (MET)   (109kb)';'   We reconsider differential geometry from the point of view of the quantum theory of non-relativistic spinning particles, which provides examples of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. This enables us to encode geometrical structure in algebraic data consisting of an algebra of functions on a manifold and a family of supersymmetry generators represented on a Hilbert space. We show that known types of differential geometry can be classified in terms of the supersymmetries they exhibit. Replacing commutative algebras of functions by non-commutative *-algebras of operators, while retaining supersymmetry, we arrive at a formulation of non-commutative geometry encompassing and extending Connes' original approach. We explore different types of non-commutative geometry and introduce notions of non-commutative manifolds and non-commutative phase spaces. One of the main motivations underlying our work is to construct mathematical tools for novel formulations of quantum gravity, in particular for the investigation of superstring vacua. '

This allows for a systematic discussion of non-equilibrium physics and the approach to equilibrium without the need of solving the nonlinear microscopic equations of motion or computing the time dependence of the probability distribution explicitly.

9612207;'Confinement in N=1 SUSY Gauge Theories and Model Building Tools';'Csaba Csaki (MIT), Martin Schmaltz (Boston U.) and Witold Skiba (MIT)';'Thu, 19 Dec 1996 13:47:44 -0500   (28kb)';'   We develop a systematic approach to confinement in N=1 supersymmetric theories. We identify simple necessary conditions for theories to confine without chiral symmetry breaking and to generate a superpotential non-perturbatively (s-confine). Applying these conditions we identify all N=1 theories with a single gauge group and no tree-level superpotential which s-confine. We give a complete list of the confined spectra and superpotentials. Some of these theories are of great interest for model building. We give several new examples of models which break supersymmetry dynamically. '

Hull';'Thu, 19 Dec 1996 19:46:31 GMT   (10kb)';'   The geometry of (2,1) supersymmetric sigma-models is reviewed and the conditions under which they have isometry symmetries are analysed. Certain potentials are constructed that play an important role in the gauging of such symmetries. The gauged action is found for a special class of models. '
9612209;'Weil Algebras and Supersymmetry';'Mauri Miettinen (Uppsala University)';'Fri, 20 Dec 1996 11:56:04 +0200 (EET)   (12kb)';'   We give a new interpretation for the super loop space that has been used to formulate supersymmetry. The fermionic coordinates in the super loop space are identified as the odd generators of the Weil algebra. Their bosonic superpartners are the auxiliary fields. The general N=1 supermultiplet is interpreted in terms of Weil algebras. As specific examples we consider supersymmetric quantum mechanics, Wess-Zumino model and supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. Some comments on the formulation of constrained systems and integrable models and non-Abelian localization are given. '

The connection between B=2 SO(3)-hedgehog and SU(2)-torus is investigated and the quantization of the dipole- type configuration with large strangeness content is described. '
9612212;'A new Hamiltonian for a massive relativistic particle with spin one in a';'Rudolf A. Frick';'Fri, 20 Dec 1996 13:19:43 +0100   (9kb)';'   We consider a particular 4-dimensional generalization of the transition from the Heisenberg to the Schr\"odinger picture. The space-time independent expansion with respect to the unitary irreducible representations of the Lorentz group is applied, as Fourier transformation in the Heisenberg picture, to the states of a massive relativistic particle. A new Hamiltonian operator has been found for such a particle with spin one. '
9612213;'Classical Interactions for Tensionless Strings';'Bj\o rn Jensen and Ulf Lindstr\"om';'Fri, 20 Dec 1996 13:20:17 +0100 (MET)   (8kb)';'   Using an ``action at a distance'' formulation we probe the possible classical interactions for tensionless strings, (the $T\rightarrow 0$ limit of the ordinary bosonic string.) We find $G_{\mu\nu}$ and $B_{\mu\nu}$ type interactions but no dilaton interactions. '
9612214;'Running coupling expansion for the renormalized $\phi^4_4$-trajectory';'Christian Wieczerkowski (University of Muenster)';'Fri, 20 Dec 1996 17:32:38 +0100   (12kb)';'   We formulate a renormalized running coupling expansion for the $\beta$--function and the potential of the renormalized $\phi^4$--trajectory on four dimensional Euclidean space-time. Renormalization invariance is used as a first principle. No reference is made to bare quantities. The expansion is proved to be finite to all orders of perturbation theory. The proof includes a large momentum bound on the connected free propagator amputated vertices. '
9612215;'Antibranes and crossing symmetry';'Vipul Periwal';'Fri, 20 Dec 1996 13:11:54 MST   (7kb)';'   Crossing symmetry appears in Dbrane-anti-Dbrane dynamics in the form of an analytic continuation from U(N) for N brane amplitudes to U(N-p,p) for the interactions of N-p branes with p anti-branes. I consider the consequences for supersymmetry and brane-anti-brane forces. '
9612216;'Hyper-Kahler Geometry and Invariants of Three-Manifolds';'L. Rozansky, E. Witten';'Fri, 20 Dec 1996 10:58:57 -0600 (CST)   (53kb)';'   We study a 3-dimensional topological sigma-model, whose target space is a hyper-Kahler manifold X. A Feynman diagram calculation of its partition function demonstrates that it is a finite type invariant of 3-manifolds which is similar in structure to those appearing in the perturbative calculation of the Chern-Simons partition function.   The sigma-model suggests a new system of weights for finite type invariants of 3-manifolds, described by trivalent graphs. The Riemann curvature of X plays the role of Lie algebra structure constants in Chern-Simons theory, and the Bianchi identity plays the role of the Jacobi identity in guaranteeing the so-called IHX relation among the weights.   We argue that, for special choices of X, the partition function of the sigma-model yields the Casson-Walker invariant and its generalizations. We also derive Walker's surgery formula from the SL(2,Z) action on the finite-dimensional Hilbert space obtained by quantizing the sigma-model on a two-dimensional torus. '
9612217;'Logarithmic Yangians in WZW models';'D. Bernard, Z. Maassarani and P. Mathieu';'Fri, 20 Dec 1996 14:43:16 -0500   (13kb)';'   A new action of the Yangians in the WZW models is displayed. Its structure is generic and level independent. This Yangian is the natural extension at the conformal point of the one unravelled in massive theories with current algebras. Expectingly, this new symmetry of WZW models will lead to a deeper understanding of the integrable structure of conformal field theories and their deformations. '
9612218;'Path-Integral Quantization of the (2,2) String';'Jan Bischoff and Olaf Lechtenfeld (Univ. of Hannover, Germany)';'Sat, 21 Dec 1996 02:50:02 -0500 (EST)   (40kb)';'   A complete treatment of the (2,2) NSR string in flat (2+2) dimensional space-time is given, from the formal path integral over N=2 super Riemann surfaces to the computational recipe for amplitudes at any loop or gauge instanton number. We perform in detail the superconformal gauge fixing, discuss the spectral flow, and analyze the supermoduli space with emphasis on the gauge moduli. Background gauge field configurations in all instanton sectors are constructed. We develop chiral bosonization on punctured higher-genus surfaces in the presence of gauge moduli and instantons. The BRST cohomology is recapitulated, with a new space-time interpretation for picture-changing. We point out two ways of combining left- and right-movers, which lead to different three-point functions. '
9612219;'Higher Topologies in 2+1-Gravity';'Marcello Ciafaloni (Dipartimento di Fisica, Universit\`a di Firenze and';'Sat, 21 Dec 1996 11:20:19 +0100   (6kb)';'   I argue that the first-order formalism recently found to describe classical 2+1-Gravity with matter, is also able to include higher topologies. The present gauge, which is conformal with vanishing York time, is characterized by an analytic mapping from single-valued coordinates to Minkowskian ones. In the torus case, this mapping is based on four square-root branch points, whose location is related to the modulus, which has a well defined time dependence. In the general case, it is connected with the hyperelliptic representation of Riemann surfaces. '
9612220;'Chiral Reductions of the M-Algebra';'E. Sezgin';'Sat, 21 Dec 1996 21:30:25 -0600   (10kb)';'   We present the chiral truncation of the eleven dimensional M-algebra down to ten and six dimensions. In ten dimensions, we obtain a topological extension of the $(1,0)$ Poincar\'e superalgebra that includes super one-form and super five-form charges. Closed super three- and seven-forms associated with this algebra are constructed. In six dimensions, we obtain a topological extension of the $(2,0)$ and $(1,0)$ Poincar\'e superalgebras. The former includes a quintet of super one-form charges, and a decuplet of super three-form charges, while the latter includes a triplet of super three-form charges. '

Evidence of the existence of correspondence between BPS magnetic monopoles and space-time hyper-K\"ahler metrics is given. '
9612222;'Strings from IIB Matrices';'Miao Li';'Sat, 21 Dec 1996 18:28:18 -0600 (CST)   (9kb)';'   D-string action is constructed from IIB matrices, a spacetime commutator is essential in this construction. This hints at the central role of the spacetime uncertainty relation in a unified formulation of strings. Vertex operators of fundamental strings are also discussed. '

Computing the velocity dependent potential between these configurations and gravitons and membranes, we show that they agree with the short distance string results computed in type IIa string theory. Due to the ``closeness'' of these configuration to a supersymmetric configuration the m(atrix) theory reproduces the correct long distance behavior. '

We discuss two different ways in which extremal p-branes can be generalised to non-extremal ones, and show how wide classes of recently discussed cosmological models can be mapped into non-extremal p-brane solutions of one of these two kinds. We also extend previous discussions of cosmological solutions to include some that make use of cosmological-type terms in the effective action that can arise from the generalised dimensional reduction of string theory or M-theory.

We use an exact functional differential equation for its dependence on the running $\phi^4$-coupling. It is solved by means of perturbation theory. The expansion is proved to be finite to all orders. The proof includes a large momentum bound on amputated connected momentum space Green's functions. '
9612228;'On Connes' new principle of general relativity. Can spinors hear the';'Lionel Carminati, Bruno Iochum, Daniel Kastler, Thomas Schucker';'Mon, 23 Dec 1996 18:59:20 +0100 (MET)   (16kb)';'   Connes has extended Einstein's principle of general relativity to noncommutative geometry. The new principle implies that the Dirac operator is covariant with respect to Lorentz and internal gauge transformations and the Dirac operator must include Yukawa couplings. It further implies that the action for the metric, the gauge potentials and the Higgs scalar is coded in the spectrum of the covariant Dirac operator. This ``universal'' action has been computed by Chamseddine & Connes, it is the coupled Einstein-Hilbert and Yang-Mills-Higgs action. This result is rederived and we discuss the physical consequences.

We identify harmonic functions, associated with each M-brane, and non-extremality functions, specifying a deviation from the BPS limit. These functions are modified due to the angular momentum parameters, which specify the rotation along the transverse directions of the M-branes. We spell out the intersection rules for the eleven-dimensional space-time metric for intersecting (up to three) rotating M-brane configurations (and a boost along the common intersecting direction).

The equivalence of various definitions of self-duality is proven. We show that the self-dual 2-forms determine a n^2-n+1 dimensional manifold S_{2n} and the dimension of the maximal linear subspaces of S_{2n}$ is equal to the Radon-Hurwitz number of linearly independent vector fields on the sphere S^{2n-1}. The relation between the maximal linear subspaces and the representations of Clifford algebras is noted. A general procedure based on this relation for the explicit construction of linearly self-dual 2-forms is given. The construction of the octonionic instanton solution in D=8 dimensions is discussed.

We calculate the quantum modulus u = <Tr(A^2)> at the 1-instanton level, and find a discrepancy with Seiberg and Witten's proposed exact solution. As in related models (N=2, N_F=3 or 4), this discrepancy may be resolved by modifying their proposed relation between $\tilde u$ (the parameter in the elliptic curve) and u. '

It is shown that the theory allows two different Ernst-like $d \times d$ matrix formulations: the real non-dualized target space and the Hermitian dualized non-target space ones. The O(d, d) symmetry is written in a SL(2,R) matrix-valued form in both cases. The Kramer-Neugebauer transformation, which algebraically maps the non-dualized Ernst potential into the dualized one, is presented. '

We introduce the contact terms naturally and prove space-time supersymmetry and gauge invariance. The nonlinear realization of broken supersymmetry in the presence of D-branes is also discussed. The shift of fermionic coordinate \delta^{(-)}\Psi =\eta becomes exact symmetry of D-brane in the static gauge, where $\eta$ is a constant spinor in U(1) direction. '
9612235;'A $\hbar$-deformed Virasoro Algebra as Hidden Symmetry of the Restricted';'Bo-yu Hou, Wen-li Yang';'Thu, 26 Dec 96 15:11:05 CST   (7kb)';'   As the Yangian double with center,which is deformed from affine algebra by the additive loop parameter $\hbar$ ,we get the commuting relation and the bosonization of quantum $\hbar$-deformed Virasoro algebra. The corresponding Miura transformation, associated screening operators and the BRST charge have been studied. Moreover, we also constructe the bosonization for type I and type II intertwiner vertex operators. Finally, we show that the commuting relation of these vertex operators in the case of $p'=r p=r-1$ and $\hbar =\pi$ actually gives the exact scattering matrix of the Restricted sine-Gordon model. '

An incidence matrix describing configurations of electric and magnetic fields is introduced. Intersecting p-branes are specified by solutions of a system of characteristic algebraic equations for the incidence matrix. This set of characteristic equations generalizes a single characteristic equation found before for a special "flower" ansatz. The characteristic equations admit solutions only for quantized values of scalar coupling parameters. A wide list of examples including solutions with regular horizons and non-zero entropy in D=11 and D=10 theories is presented. '
9612237;'Renormalization group approach to multiple-arc random matrix models';'S. Higuchi, C. Itoi, S. M. Nishigaki, N. Sakai';'Thu, 26 Dec 1996 16:23:23 +0100   (17kb)';'   We study critical and universal behaviors of unitary invariant non-gaussian random matrix ensembles within the framework of the large-N renormalization group. For a simple double-well model we find an unstable fixed point and a stable inverse-gaussian fixed point. The former is identified as the critical point of single/double-arc phase transition with a discontinuity of the third derivative of the free energy. The latter signifies a novel universality of large-N correlators other than the usual single arc type. This phase structure is consistent with the universality classification of two-level correlators for multiple-arc models by Ambjorn and Akemann. We also establish the stability of the gaussian fixed point in the multi-coupling model. '
9612238;'Branes and integrability in the N=2 SUSY YM theory';'Alexander Gorsky';'Thu, 26 Dec 1996 20:46:38 EET   (8kb)';'   We suggest the brane interpretation of the integrable dynamics behind the exact solution to the N=2 SUSY YM theory. Degrees of freedom of the Calogero type integrable system responsible for the appearance of the spectral Riemann surfaces originate from the collective coordinates of the dynamical branes. The second Whitham type integrable system corresponds to the low energy scattering of branes similar to the scattering of the magnetic monopoles. '
9612239;'Mirror Symmetry and the Web of Landau-Ginzburg String Vacua';'Hitoshi Sato';'Fri, 27 Dec 96 13:05:11 +0900   (17kb)';'   We present some mathematical aspects of Landau-Ginzburg string vacua in terms of toric geometry. The one-to-one correspondence between toric divisors and some of (-1,1) states in Landau-Ginzburg model is presented for superpotentials of typical types. The Landau-Ginzburg interpretation of non-toric divisors is also presented. Using this interpretation, we propose a method to solve the so-called "twisted sector problem" by orbifold construction. Moreover,this construction shows that the moduli spaces of the original Landau-Ginzburg string vacua and their orbifolds are connected. By considering the mirror map of Landau-Ginzburg models, we obtain the relation between Mori vectors and the twist operators of our orbifoldization. This consideration enables us to argue the embedding of the Seiberg-Witten curve in the defining equation of the Calabi-Yau manifoulds on which the type II string gets compactified. Related topics concerning the Calabi-Yau fourfolds and the extremal transition are discussed. '

This is achieved by evaluating the integral representation in the weak coupling region, and by using analytic continuation to the conformal point. The explicit representation is shown for the SU(2) theory with matter fields and also for pure SU(N) and pure SO(2N) theory around the conformal point where the relation to the beta function of the theory is clarified. We also discuss a relation between the fixed points in the SU(2) theories with matter fields and the Landau-Ginzburg point of 2-D N=2 SCFT. '
9612241;'On the Integrability Aspects of the Self Dual Membrane';'Carlos Castro';'Fri, 27 Dec 1996 00:12:32 -0600   (47kb)';'   The exact quantum integrability aspects of a sector of the membrane is investigated. It is found that spherical membranes moving in flat target spacetime backgrounds admit a class of integrable solutions linked to SU(infty) SDYM equations (dimensionally reduced to one temporal dimension). After a suitable ansatz, the SDYM equations can be recast in the form of the continuous Toda molecule equations whose symmetry algebra is the dimensional reduction of the W (infty} plus {\bar W}(infty} algebra. The latter algebra is explicitly constructed. Highest weight representations are built directly from the infinite number of defining relations among the highest weight states of W(\infty) algebras and the quantum states of the Toda molecule. Discrete states are also constructed. The full (dimensionaly reduced) quantum SU(infty) YM theory remains to be explored. '

We review the connection of RMT with these areas. We also discuss the method of loop equations for determining correlation functions in RMT, and smoothed global eigenvalue correlators in the 2-matrix model for gaussian orthogonal, unitary and symplectic ensembles.

Volkov (1,2) ((1) INFN Sezione di';'Sat, 28 Dec 1996 01:19:40 GMT+03:00   (25kb)';'   In the framework of the four dimensional heterotic superstring with free fermions we discuss the rank eight and/or sixteen Grand Unified String Theories (GUST) which contain the SU(3)_H - gauge family symmetry. We explicitly investigate the paths of the unification in the GUST with gauge symmetry G x G = [SU(5) x U(1) x (SU(3) x U(1))_H]^2. We show that the GUSTs with the G x G gauge group allow to make the scale of unification to be consistent with the string scale M_SU = g_{string} * 5 * 10^17 GeV. '

9612246;'Topology Change and theta-Vacua in 2D Yang-Mills Theory';'Tom D. Imbo and P. Teotonio-Sobrinho';'Sun, 29 Dec 1996 14:48:20 MST   (26kb)';'   We discuss the existence of $\theta$-vacua in pure Yang-Mills theory in two space-time dimensions. More precisely, a procedure is given which allows one to classify the distinct quantum theories possessing the same classical limit for an arbitrary connected gauge group G and compact space-time manifold M (possibly with boundary) possessing a special basepoint. For any such G and M it is shown that the above quantizations are in one-to-one correspondence with the irreducible unitary representations (IUR's) of $\pi_1(G)$ if M is orientable, and with the IUR's of $\pi_1(G)/2\pi_1(G)$ if M is nonorientable.

9612247;'Anomalous Defects and Their Quantized Transverse Conductivities';'A.P. Balachandran, V. John, Arshad Momen and F. Moraes';'Sun, 29 Dec 96 16:52:48 -0500   (26kb)';'   Using a description of defects in solids in terms of three-dimensional gravity, we study the propagation of electrons in the background of disclinations and screw dislocations. We study the situations where there are bound states that are effectively localized on the defect and hence can be described in terms of an effective 1+1 dimensional field theory for the low energy excitations. In the case of screw dislocations, we find that these excitations are chiral and can be described by an effective field theory of chiral fermions. Fermions of both chirality occur even for a given direction of the magnetic field. The ``net'' chirality of the system however is not always the same for a given direction of the magnetic field, but changes from one sign of the chirality through zero to the other sign as the Fermi momentum or the magnitude of the magnetic flux is varied. On coupling to an external electromagnetic field, the latter becomes anomalous, and predicts novel conduction properties for these materials. '
9612248;'Wavy Strings: Black or Bright?';'Nemanja Kaloper, Robert C. Myers and Harold Roussel';'Sun, 29 Dec 1996 23:29:57 -0500 (EST)   (39kb)';'   Recent developments in string theory have brought forth a considerable interest in time-dependent hair on extended objects. This novel new hair is typically characterized by a wave profile along the horizon and angular momentum quantum numbers $l,m$ in the transverse space. In this work, we present an extensive treatment of such oscillating black objects, focusing on their geometric properties. We first give a theorem of purely geometric nature, stating that such wavy hair cannot be detected by any scalar invariant built out of the curvature and/or matter fields. However, we show that the tidal forces detected by an infalling observer diverge at the `horizon' of a black string superposed with a vibration in any mode with $l \ge 1$. The same argument applied to longitudinal ($l=0$) waves detects only finite tidal forces. We also provide an example with a manifestly smooth metric, proving that at least a certain class of these longitudinal waves have regular horizons. '

9612250;'Gauge Independence in terms of the Functional Integral';'T. Kashiwa and N. Tanimura (Kyushu Univ. Fukuoka, Japan)';'Tue, 31 Dec 1996 04:52:07 +0900   (175kb)';'   Among various approaches in proving gauge independence, models containing an explicit gauge dependence are convenient. The well-known example is the gauge parameter in the covariant gauge fixing which is of course most suitable for the perturbation theory but a negative metric prevents us from imaging a dynamical picture. Noncovariant gauge such as the Coulomb gauge is on the contrary used for many physical situations. Therefore it is desirable to include both cases. More than ten years ago, Steinmann introduced a function (distribution) which can play this role in his attempt on discussing quantum electrodynamics (QED) in terms of the gauge invariant fields solely. The method is, however, broken down in the covariant case: the invariant operators are ill-defined because of 1/p^2 singularity in the Minkowski space. In this paper, we apply his function to the path integral: utilizing the arbitrariness of the function we first restrict it to be able to have a well- defined operator, and then a Hamiltonian with which we can build up the (Euclidean) path integral formula. Although the formula is far from covariant, a full covariant expression is recovered by reviving the components which have been discarded under the construction of the Hamiltonian. There is no pathological defects contrary to the operator formalism. With the aid of the path integral formula, the gauge independence of the free energy as well as the S-matrix is proved. Moreover the reason is clarified why it is so simple and straightforward to argue gauge transformations in the path integral. Discussions on the quark confinement is also presented. '

Szabo';'Mon, 30 Dec 1996 21:05:42 GMT   (12kb)';'   We discuss some properties of a supersymmetric matrix model that is the dimensional reduction of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in ten dimensions and which has been recently argued to represent the short-distance structure of M theory in the infinite momentum frame. We describe a reduced version of the matrix quantum mechanics and derive the Nicolai map of the simplified supersymmetric matrix model. We use this to argue that there are no phase transitions in the large-N limit, and hence that S-duality is preserved in the full eleven dimensional theory. '

Slavnov';'Tue, 31 Dec 96 07:17:12 JST   (14kb)';'   Correlation functions of exactly solvable models can be described by differential equation [Barough, McCoy, Wu]. In this paper we show that for non free fermionic case differential equations should be replaced by integro-differential equations.   We derive an integro-differential equation, which describes time and temperature dependent correlation function $<\psi(0,0)\psi^\dagger(x,t)>_T$ of penetrable Bose gas. The integro-differential equation turns out be the continuum generalization of classical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. '

These results extend the results known for the case A_N. It is shown that there exist Q independent supertraces where Q(B_N)=Q(C_N) is a number of partitions of N into a sum of positive integers and Q(D_N) is a number of partitions of N into a sum of positive integers with even number of even integers.

It is an introductory course designed to provide students with minimum knowledge before they attend more advanced courses on non-perturbative aspects of string theories in the School.

The goal of the lectures is to make the recent exciting developments in string theory accessible to those with no previous background in string theory who wish to join the research effort in this area.

9702202;'Hyper-Kahler manifolds and multiply-intersecting branes';'J.P. Gauntlett, G.W. Gibbons, G. Papadopoulos and P.K. Townsend';'Thu, 27 Feb 97 19:16:03 GMT   (27kb)';'   Generalized membrane solutions of D=11 supergravity, for which the transverse space is a toric hyper-K{\" a}hler manifold, are shown to have IIB duals representing the intersection of parallel 3-branes with 5-branes whose orientations are determined by their $Sl(2;\bZ)$ charge vectors. These IIB solutions, which generically preserve 3/16 of the supersymmetry, can be further mapped to solutions of D=11 supergravity representing the intersection of parallel membranes with any number of fivebranes at arbitrary angles. Alternatively, a subclass (corresponding to non-singular D=11 solutions) can be mapped to solutions representing the intersection on a string of any number of D-5-branes at arbitrary angles, again preserving 3/16 supersymmetry, as we verify in a special case by a quaternionic extension of the analysis of Berkooz, Douglas and Leigh. We also use similar methods to find new 1/8 supersymmetric solutions of orthogonally intersecting branes. '

Shenker';'Thu, 27 Feb 1997 17:15:48 -0500   (12kb)';'   We discuss issues concerning M(atrix) theory compactifications on curved spaces. We argue from the form of the graviton propagator on curved space that excited string states do not decouple from the annulus D0-brane $v^4$ amplitude, unlike the flat space case. This argument shows that a large class of quantum mechanical systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom cannot reproduce supergravity answers. We discuss the specific example of an ALE space and suggest sources of possible higher derivative terms that might help reproduce supergravity results. '
9702204;'On the Wavefunctional for Two Heavy Color Sources in Yang-Mills Theory';'Peter E. Haagensen and Kenneth Johnson';'Thu, 27 Feb 1997 18:17:23 -0500 (EST)   (16kb)';'   In an abelian gauge theory, the Coulombic potential between two static charges is obtained most directly when a correct separation between gauge-invariant and gauge degrees of freedom is made. This motivates a similar separation in the nonabelian theory. When a careful identification of the Hilbert space is made, along with the proper analyticity requirements, it is then possible to find the appropriate wavefunctionals describing heavy color sources in the theory. This treatment is consistent with, and realizes in a simple way the center symmetry Z_N of SU(N) gauge theories. '
9702205;'BPS-Saturated Bound States of Tilted P-Branes in Type II String Theory';'Klaus Behrndt, Mirjam Cvetic';'Thu, 27 Feb 97 20:05:33 -0500   (25kb)';'   We found BPS-saturated solutions of M-theory and Type II string theory which correspond to (non-marginally) bound states of p-branes intersecting at angles different from pi/2. These solutions are obtained by starting with a BPS marginally bound (orthogonally) intersecting configurations of two p-branes (e.g, two four-branes of Type II string theory), performing a boost transformation at an angle with respect to the world-volume of the configuration, performing T-duality transformation along the boost-direction, S-duality transformation, and T- transformations along the direction perpendicular to the boost transformation. The resulting configuration is non-marginally bound BPS-saturated solution whose static metric possesses the off-diagonal term which cannot be removed by a coordinate transformation, and thus signifies an angle (different from pi/2) between the resulting intersecting p-branes. Additional new p-branes are bound to this configuration, in order to ensure the stability of such a static, tilted configuration. '

We then compute certain scattering processes and show that they have the expected SO(5) invariance, give the correct transverse-five-brane mass, and agree with the supergravity result. '
9703202;'Higgs Mechanism in String Theory';'Jonathan Bagger and Ioannis Giannakis';'Thu, 27 Mar 97 15:51:14 -0500   (11kb)';'   In first-quantized string theory, spacetime symmetries are described by inner automorphisms of the underlying conformal field theory. In this paper we use this approach to illustrate the Higgs effect in string theory. We consider string propagation on M^{24,1} \times S^1, where the circle has radius R, and study SU(2) symmetry breaking as R moves away from its critical value. We find a gauge-covariant equation of motion for the broken-symmetry gauge bosons and the would-be Goldstone bosons. We show that the Goldstone bosons can be eliminated by an appropriate gauge transformation. In this unitary gauge, the Goldstone bosons become the longitudinal components of massive gauge bosons. '
9703203;'Universal Hidden Supersymmetry in Classical Mechanics and its Local';'Ennio Gozzi';'Thu, 27 Mar 1997 23:59:31 GMT   (8kb)';'   We review here a path-integral approach to classical mechanics and explore the geometrical meaning of this construction. In particular we bring to light a universal hidden BRS invariance and its geometrical relevance for the Cartan calculus on symplectic manifolds. Together with this BRS invariance we also show the presence of a universal hidden genuine non-relativistic supersymmetry. In an attempt to understand its geometry we make this susy local following the analogous construction done for the supersymmetric quantum mechanics of Witten. '
9703204;'Non-threshold D-brane bound states and black holes with non-zero entropy';'Miguel S. Costa and Mirjam Cvetic';'Thu, 27 Mar 97 19:54:25 -0500   (15kb)';'   We start with BPS-saturated configurations of two (orthogonally) intersecting M-branes and use the electro-magnetic duality or dimensional reduction along a boost, in order to obtain new p-brane bound states. In the first case the resulting configurations are interpreted as BPS-saturated non-threshold bound states of intersecting p-branes, and in the second case as p-branes intersecting at angles and their duals. As a by-product we deduce the enhancement of supersymmetry as the angle approaches zero. We also comment on the D-brane theory describing these new bound states, and a connection between the angle and the world-volume gauge fields of the D-brane system. We use these configurations to find new embeddings of the four and five dimensional black holes with non-zero entropy, whose entropy now also depends on the angle and world-volume gauge fields. The corresponding D-brane configuration sheds light on the microscopic entropy of such black holes. '
9703206;'Systematics of string loop threshold corrections in orbifold models';'Marc Chemtob';'Fri, 28 Mar 1997 10:27:34 +0100   (86kb)';'   String theory one-loop threshold corrections are studied in a background field approach due to Kiritsis and Kounnas which uses space-time curvature as an infrared regulator. We review the conformal field theory aspects using the semiwormhole space-time solution. The comparison of string and effective field theories vacuum functionals is made for the low derivative order, as well as for certain higher-derivative, gauge and gravitational interactions. We study the dependence on the infrared cut-off. Numerical applications are considered for a sample of four-dimensional abelian orbifold models. The implications on the perturbative string theory unification are examined. We present numerical results for the gauge interactions coupling constants as well as for the quadratic order gravitational ($R^2$) and the quartic order gauge ($F^4$) interactions. '
9703207;'Bosonic Super Liouville System: Lax Pair and Solution';'Liu Zhao, Changzheng Qu';'Fri, 28 Mar 97 17:58:06 CST   (8kb)';'   We study the bosonic super Liouville system which is a statistical transmutation of super Liouville system.

Smith';'Sat, 29 Mar 1997 09:09:12 MST   (6kb)';'   We study the T^5/Z_2 orbifold compactification of the M-theory matrix model. This model was originally studied by Dasgupta, Mukhi, and Witten. It was found that one had to add 16 5-branes to the system to make the compactification consistent. We demonstrate how this is mimicked in the matrix model. '
9703209;'Matrix Strings in Two-dimensional Yang-Mills Theory';'Ian I. Kogan and Richard J.

We show that the theory admits topological instanton field configurations which at short-distance scales reduce to ordinary Yang-Mills instantons that interpolate between degenerate vacua of the theory. We show that there exists further classes of hadronic strings associated with the D-string super-fields. We discuss the relationships between these non-perturbative string states and rigid QCD strings, critical strings, and membrane states. '
9703210;'Orientifolds, Branes, and Duality of 4D Gauge Theories';'Nick Evans, Clifford V. Johnson, Alfred D. Shapere';'Fri, 28 Mar 1997 15:12:31 -0500   (27kb)';'   Recently, a D-brane construction in type IIA string theory was shown to yield the electric/magnetic duality of four dimensional N=1 supersymmetric U(N_c) gauge theories with N_f flavours of quark. We present here an extension of that construction which yields the electric/magnetic duality for the SO(N_c) and USp(N_c) gauge theories with N_f quarks, by adding an orientifold plane which is consistent with the supersymmetry. Due to the intersection of the orientifold plane with the NS-NS fivebranes already present, new features arise which are crucial in determining the correct final structure of the dualities. '

We discuss realizations of these objects in matrix models of M-theory, investigate the properties of zero-brane probes, and propose a measure of their internal density. A scenario for black hole dynamics is presented. '

In the slowly varying envelope and rotating wave approximations, the equations of motion are shown to satisfy a zero curvature representation, implying integrability of the quantum system. '
9703213;'Left-right symmetric gauge model in a noncommutative geometry on';'Yoshitaka Okumura';'Sat, 29 Mar 1997 16:39:59 +0900   (22kb)';'   The left-right symmetric gauge model with the symmetry of $SU(3)_c\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1)$ is reconstructed in a new scheme of the noncommutative differential geometry (NCG) on the discrete space $M_4\times Z_4$ which is a product space of Minkowski space and four points space. The characteristic point of this new scheme is to take the fermion field to be a vector in a 24-dimensional space which contains all leptons and quarks. Corresponding to this specification, all gauge and Higgs boson fields are represented in $24\times 24$ matrix forms. We incorporate two Higgs doublet bosons $h$ and $SU(2)_R$ adjoint Higgs $\xi_R$ which are as usual transformed as $(2,2^\ast,0)$ and $(1,3,-2)$ under $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1)$, respectively. Owing to the revise of the algebraic rules in a new NCG, we can obtain the necessary potential and interacting terms between these Higgs bosons which are responsible for giving masses to the particles included. Among the Higgs doublet bosons, one CP-even scalar boson survives in the weak energy scale and other four scalar bosons acquire the mass of the $SU(2)_R\times U(1)$ breaking scale, which is similar to the situation in the standard model. $\xi_R$ is responsible to spontaneously break $SU(2)\ma{R} \times U(1)$ down to $U(1)\ma{Y}$ and so well explains the seesaw mechanism. Up and down quarks have the different masses through the vacuum expectation value of $h$. '
9703214;'Supergravity in 10 + 2 Dimensions as Consistent Background for';'Hitoshi Nishino';'Sat, 29 Mar 1997 03:25:07 EST   (25kb)';'   We present a consistent theory of N=1 supergravity in twelve-dimensions with the signature (10,2). Even though the formulation uses two null vectors violating the manifest Lorentz covariance, all the superspace Bianchi identities are satisfied. After a simple dimensional reduction to ten-dimensions, this theory reproduces the N=1 supergravity in ten-dimensions, supporting the consistency of the system. We also show that our supergravity can be the consistent backgrounds for heterotic or type-I superstring in Green-Schwarz formulation, by confirming the kappa-invariance of the total action. This theory is supposed to be the purely N=1 supergravity sector for the field theory limit of the recently predicted F-theory in twelve-dimensions. '

We relate this duality to the IR duality of d=4 N=1 SQCD theories, and in one case also to mirror symmetry. '
9703216;'Testing Effective String Models of Black Holes with Fixed Scalars';'Michael Krasnitz and Igor R. Klebanov';'Sun, 30 Mar 1997 14:16:13 -0500   (13kb)';'   We solve the problem of mixing between the fixed scalar and metric fluctuations. First, we derive the decoupled fixed scalar equation for the four-dimensional black hole with two different charges. We proceed to the five-dimensional black hole with different electric (1-brane) and magnetic (5-brane) charges, and derive two decoupled equations satisfied by appropriate mixtures of the original fixed scalar fields. The resulting greybody factors are proportional to those that follow from coupling to dimension (2,2) operators on the effective string. In general, however, the string action also contains couplings to chiral operators of dimension (1,3) and (3,1), which cause disagreements with the semiclassical absorption cross-sections. Implications of this for the effective string models are discussed. '
9703217;'Fluctuation Spectra of Tilted and Intersecting D-branes from the';'Akikazu Hashimoto and Washington Taylor IV';'Sun, 30 Mar 1997 15:51:17 MST   (29kb)';'   We consider the spectra of excitations around diagonal and intersecting D-brane configurations on tori. These configurations are described by constant curvature connections in a dual gauge theory description. The low-energy string fluctuation spectrum is reproduced exactly by the gauge theory in the case of vanishing field strength; however, this correspondence breaks down for fixed nonzero field strength. We show that in many cases the full Born-Infeld action correctly captures the low-energy spectrum in the case of non-vanishing field strength. This gives a field theory description of the low-energy physics of systems of diagonally wound branes and branes at angles as considered by Berkooz, Douglas and Leigh. This description extends naturally to non-supersymmetric configurations, where the tachyonic instability associated with brane-anti-brane systems appears as an instability around a saddle point solution of the corresponding Yang-Mills/Born-Infeld theory. In some cases, the field theory description requires a non-abelian generalization of the Born-Infeld action. We follow Tseytlin's recent proposal for formulating such an action. In the case of intersecting branes, the non-abelian Born-Infeld theory produces a transcendental relation which comes tantalizingly close to reproducing the correct spectrum; however, a discrepancy remains which indicates that a further clarification of the non-abelian Born-Infeld action may be necessary.

We illustrate the techniques to write the loop amplitudes in coordinate space. The short-distance expansion method is developed to perform the Fourier transformation of the amplitudes into momentum space and the possible renormalization ambiguity in Chern-Simons type gauge theories in terms of differential regularization is discussed. We also stress that the surface terms appearing in the differential regularization should be kept along for finite theories and they will result in the finite renormalization ambiguity. '

This system is an N=4 extension of at once two hierarchies, N=2 NLS and N=2 mKdV ones. It is related to N=4 KdV hierarchy via a generalized Sugawara-Feigin-Fuks construction which relates N=2 $\hat{sl(2)\oplus u(1)}$ algebra to ``small'' N=4 SCA. We also find the underlying affine hierarchy for another integrable system with the N=4 SCA second hamiltonian structure, ``quasi'' N=4 KdV hierarchy. It respects only N=2 supersymmetry. For both new hierarchies we construct scalar Lax formulations. We speculate that any N=2 affine algebra admitting a quaternionic structure possesses N=4 supersymmetry and so can be used to produce N=4 supersymmetric hierarchies. This suggests a way of classifying all such hierarchies. '

Hsu and Myckola Schwetz (Yale U)';'Mon, 31 Mar 97 14:53:33 -0500   (11kb)';'   Using a simple observation based on holomorphy, we argue that any model which spontaneously breaks supersymmetry for some range of a parameter will do so generically for all values of that parameter, modulo some isolated exceptional points. Conversely, a model which preserves supersymmetry for some range of a parameter will also do so everywhere except at isolated exceptional points. We discuss how these observations can be useful in the construction of new models which break supersymmetry and discuss some simple examples. We also comment on the relation of these results to the Witten index. '

We calculate perturbative and one-instanton contributions to the Wilsonian effective action using standard weak-coupling methods. Unlike the four-dimensional case, and despite supersymmetry, the contribution of non-zero modes to the instanton measure does not cancel. Our results allow us to fix the weak-coupling boundary conditions for the differential equations which determine the hyper-Kahler metric on the quantum moduli space. We confirm the proposal of Seiberg and Witten that the Coulomb branch is equivalent, as a hyper-Kahler manifold, to the centered moduli space of two BPS monopoles constructed by Atiyah and Hitchin.

This model suggests that the Bekenstein-Hawking area formula holds for extremal black holes as well as for ordinary (non-extremal) ones. On the other hand, semiclassical studies have suggested a discontinuity between non-extremal and extremal cases. We indicate how a reconciliation has been brought about by summing over topologies. '

9704204;'Black Holes as Fundamental Strings: Comparing the Absorption of Scalars';'Roberto Emparan';'Tue, 29 Apr 1997 11:05:04 -0700 (PDT)   (18kb)';'   The recently proposed ``correspondence principle'' of Horowitz and Polchinski provides a concrete means to relate (among others) black holes with electric NS-NS charges to fundamental strings and correctly match their entropies. We test further this correspondence by examining the greybody factors in the absorption rates of neutral, minimally coupled scalars by a near extremal black hole. Perhaps surprisingly, the results disagree in general with the absorption by weakly coupled strings. Though this does not disprove the correspondence, it indicates that it might not be simple in this region of the black hole parameter space. '

9704206;'Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory and Riemannian Geometry';'Ricardo Schiappa';'Tue, 29 Apr 1997 18:22:05 MDT   (19kb)';'   We introduce new local gauge invariant variables for N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, explicitly parameterizing the physical Hilbert space of the theory. We show that these gauge invariant variables have a geometrical interpretation, and can be constructed such that the emergent geometry is that of N=1 supergravity: a Riemannian geometry with vector-spinor generated torsion. Full geometrization of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory is carried out, and geometry independent divergences associated to the inversion of a differential operator with zero modes -- that were encountered in the non-supersymmetric case -- do not arise in this situation.

The Poisson algebra generated by the Hamiltonian and the constraints closes and by quantization transforms into a Lie algebra. The observable of the theory is given by the Casimir operator of this algebra and coincides with the square of the angular momentum. '

It is as general as the corresponding symplectic BFV-BRST formulation and it is demonstrated to be consistent with a previously proposed formalism for antisymplectic second class constraints through a generalized conversion to corresponding first class constraints. Thereby the basic concept of gauge symmetry is extended to apply to quite a new class of gauge theories potentially possible to exist. '

9704212;'On Infravacua and Superselection Theory';'Walter Kunhardt';'Wed, 30 Apr 1997 18:41:35 +0200 (MESZ)   (17kb)';'   In the DHR theory of superselection sectors, one usually considers states which are local excitations of some vacuum state. Here, we extend this analysis to local excitations of a class of "infravacuum" states appearing in models with massless particles. We show that the corresponding superselection structure, the statistics of superselection sectors and the energy-momentum spectrum are the same as with respect to the vacuum state. (The latter result is obtained with a novel method of expressing the shape of the spectrum in terms of properties of local charge transfer cocycles.) These findings provide evidence to the effect that infravacua are a natural starting point for the analysis of the superselection structure in theories with long-range forces. '

9704214;'The Background Field Method for N = 2 Super Yang-Mills Theories in';'I. L. Buchbinder, E. I. Buchbinder, S. M. Kuzenko and B. A. Ovrut';'Wed, 30 Apr 1997 14:24:39 -0400   (14kb)';'   The background field method for N=2 super Yang-Mills theories in harmonic superspace is developed. The ghost structure of the theory is investigated. It is shown that the ghosts include two fermionic real omega-hypermultiplets (Faddeev-Popov ghosts) and one bosonic real omega-hypermultiplet (Nielsen-Kallosh ghost), all in the adjoint representation of the gauge group. The one-loop effective action is analysed in detail and it is found that its structure is determined only by the ghost corrections in the pure super Yang-Mills theory. As applied to the case of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory, realized in terms of N=2 superfields, the latter result leads to the remarkable conclusion that the one-loop effective action of the theory does not contain quantum corrections depending on the N=2 gauge superfield only. We show that the leading low-energy contribution to the one-loop effective action in the N=2 SU(2) super Yang-Mills theory coincides with Seiberg's perturbative holomorphic effective action. '
9704215;'Quantum Electrodynamics at strong Couplings';'Uwe Trittmann, Hans-Christian Pauli (Max-Planck-Institut fuer';'Wed, 30 Apr 1997 16:44:27 +0200 (MET DST)   (783kb)';'   Front form dynamics is not a manifestly rotational invariant formalism. In particular, the requirement of an invariance under rotations around the transverse axes is difficult to fulfill.In the present work it is investigated, to which extent rotational invariance is restored in the solution of a light-cone quantized field theory. The positronium spectrum in full (3+1) dimensions is calculated at an unphysically large coupling of alpha=0.3 to be sensitive for terms breaking rotational invariance and to accustomize the theory to future QCD applications. The numerical accuracy of the formalism is improved to allow for the calculation of mass eigenvalues for arbitrary components J_z of the total angular momentum. We find numerically degenerate eigenvalues as expected from rotationally invariant formalisms and the right multiplet structures up to large principal quantum numbers. The results indicate that rotational invariance is unproblematic even in front form dynamics. Another focus of the work relies on the inclusion of the annihilation channel. This enlargement of the model is non-trivial and a consistency check of the underlying theory of effective interactions. The correct numerical eigenvalue shifts, and especially the right hyperfine splitting are obtained. Moreover, the cutoff dependence of the eigenvalues is improved drastically by the annihilation channel for the triplet states. The implications of the applied effective Hamiltonian approach are discussed in detail. '

From the two-point function we extract the critical indices \nu and \eta. The results support the quantum gravity version of Fisher's scaling relation.

9705205;'String and Particle with Two Times';'Itzhak Bars and Costas Kounnas';'Tue, 27 May 97 16:38:25 +0100   (15kb)';'   An action for a string and a particle with two timelike dimensions is proposed and analyzed. Due to new gauge symmetries and associated constraints, the motion of each system in the background of the other is equivalent to effective motion with a single timelike dimension. The quantum constraints are consistent only in critical dimensions. For the bosonic system in flat spacetime the critical dimension is 27 or 28, with signature (25,2) or (26,2), depending on whether the particle is massive or massless respectively. For the supersymmetric case the critical dimensions are 11 or 12, with signature (9,2) or (10,2), under the same circumstances. Generalizations to multiparticles, strings and p-branes are outlined.

According to this idea, gravity becomes dynamical as the result of quantum effects in the system of heavy constituents of the underlying theory. The black hole entropy is related to the properties of the vacuum in the induced gravity in the presence of the horizon. We obtain the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy by direct counting the states of the constituents. '
9705208;'Ghost-free and Modular Invariant Spectra of a String in SL(2,R) and';'Yuji Satoh';'Tue, 27 May 1997 12:53:08 -0400   (18kb)';'   Spectra of a string in $ SL(2,R) $ and three dimensional (BTZ) black hole geometry are discussed. We consider a free field realization of ^sl (2,R) different from the standard ones in treatment of zero-modes. Applying this to the string model in SL(2,R), we show that the spectrum is ghost-free. The essence of the argument is the same as Bars' resolution to the ghost problem, but there are differences; for example, the currents do not contain logarithmic cuts. Moreover, we obtain a modular invariant partition function. This realization is also applicable to the analysis of the string in the three dimensional black hole geometry, the model of which is described by an orbifold of the SL(2,R) WZW model. We obtain ghost-free and modular invariant spectra for the black hole theory as well. These spectra provide examples of few sensible spectra of a string in non-trivial backgrounds with curved time and, in particular, in a black hole background with an infinite number of propagating modes. '
9705209;'Study of Three Dimensional Quantum Black Holes';'Yuji Satoh';'Tue, 27 May 1997 12:55:31 -0400   (85kb)';'   We investigate quantum aspects of the three dimensional (BTZ) black holes. The discussions are devoted to two subjects: the thermodynamics of quantum scalar fields and the string theory in the three dimensional black hole backgrounds. We take two approaches to the thermodynamics. In one approach we use mode expansion, and in the other we use Hartle-Hawking Green functions. We obtain exact expressions of mode functions, Hartle-Hawking Green functions, Green functions on a cone geometry, and thermodynamic quantities. The entropies depend largely upon methods of calculation including regularization schemes and boundary conditions. This indicates the importance of precise discussions on the definition of the thermodynamic quantities for understanding black hole entropy. Then we investigate the string theory in the framework of conformal field theory. The model is described by an orbifold of the SL(2,R) WZW model. We discuss the spectrum by solving the level matching condition and obtain winding modes. We analyze the physical states and investigate the ghost problem. Explicit examples of negative-norm physical states (ghosts) are found. Thus we discuss possibilities for obtaining a sensible theory. The tachyon propagation and the target-space geometry are also discussed. This is the first attempt to quantize a string in a black hole background with an infinite number of propagating modes. Although we cannot overcome all the problems, our results may provide a useful basis for both subjects. '

Bundle transitions are described using language recently espoused by Friedman, Morgan, Witten. In addition, partly as a check on our methods, we also study how small instantons are described in the same language, and also describe the sheaves corresponding to small instantons. '
9705211;'Quantum Groups, Roots of Unity and Particles on quantized Anti-de Sitter';'Harold Steinacker';'Tue, 27 May 97 17:30:13 PDT   (127kb)';'   Quantum groups in general and the quantum Anti-de Sitter group $U_q(so(2,3))$ in particular are studied from the point of view of quantum field theory. We show that if $q$ is a suitable root of unity, there exist finite-dimensional, unitary representations corresponding to essentially all the classical one-particle representations with (half)integer spin, with the same structure at low energies as in the classical case. In the massless case for spin $\geq 1$, the "naive" representations are unitarizable only after factoring out a subspace of "pure gauges", as classically. Unitary many-particle representations are defined, with the correct classical limit. Furthermore, we identify a remarkable element $Q$ in the center of $U_q(g)$, which plays the role of a BRST operator in the case of $U_q(so(2,3))$ at roots of unity, for any spin $\geq 1$. The associated ghosts are an intrinsic part of the indecomposable representations. We show how to define an involution on algebras of creation and anihilation operators at roots of unity, in an example corresponding to non-identical particles. It is shown how nonabelian gauge fields appear naturally in this framework, without having to define connections on fiber bundles. Integration on Quantum Euclidean space and sphere and on Anti-de Sitter space is studied as well. We give a conjecture how $Q$ can be used in general to analyze the structure of indecomposable representations, and to define a new, completely reducible associative (tensor) product of representations at roots of unity, which generalizes the standard "truncated" tensor product as well as our many-particle representations.

9705212;'Kaluza-Klein Dyons in String Theory';'Ashoke Sen';'Wed, 28 May 1997 10:21:50 +0530   (5kb)';'   S-duality of hetertotic / type II string theory compactified on a six dimensional torus requires the existence of Kaluza-Klein dyons, carrying winding charge. We identify the zero modes of the Kaluza-Klein monopole solution which are responsible for these dyonic excitations, and show that we get the correct degeneracy of dyons as predicted by S-duality. The self-dual harmonic two form on the Euclidean Taub-NUT space plays a crucial role in this construction. '

9705215;'The emergence of space-time gravitational physics as an effective theory';'Avinash Dhar';'Wed, 28 May 97 12:42:29 IST   (17kb)';'   We discuss further a recent space-time interpretation of the $c=1$ matrix model which retains both sides of the inverted harmonic oscillator potential in the underlying free fermion theory and reproduces the physics of the discrete state moduli of two-dimensional string theory. We show that within this framework the linear tachyon background in flat space arises from the fermi vacuum. We argue that this framework does not suffer from any obvious nonperturbative inconsistency. We also identify and discuss a class of nearly static configurations in the free fermion theory which are interpreted as static metric backgrounds in space-time. These backgrounds are classically absorbing --- a beam of tachyons thrown at such a background is only partly reflected back --- and are tentatively identified with the eternal back-hole of 2-dimensional string theory.

Perturbative gauge invariance, formulated exclusively by means of asymptotic fields, is discussed for the simple example of Abelian U(1) gauge theory (Abelian Higgs model). Our findings are relevant for the electroweak theory, as pointed out elsewhere. '

In 3+1 dimensions it is shown that the critical coupling constant increases with increasing of the value of the second invariant of electromagentic field $\vec{E}\cdot\vec{B}$, i.e. the second invariant inhibits $D\chi SB$. The case of 2+1 dimensions is simpler because there is only one Lorentz invariant of electromagnetic field and any combination of constant fields can be reduced to cases either purely magnetic or purely electric field.

It is shown that in this parametrization the Hamiltonians of the A_N, BC_N, B_N, C_N and D_N Calogero and Sutherland models, as well as their supersymmetric generalizations, can be expressed -- for arbitrary values of the coupling constants -- as quadratic polynomials in the generators of a Borel subalgebra of the Lie algebra gl(N+1) or the Lie superalgebra gl(N+1|N) for the supersymmetric case. These algebras are realized by first order differential operators. This fact establishes the exact solvability of the models according to the general definition given by one of the authors in 1994, and implies that the Calogero and Jack-Sutherland polynomials, as well as their supersymmetric generalizations, are related to finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the Lie algebra gl(N+1) and the Lie superalgebra gl(N+1|N).

We use this result and T-duality of a further compacitification on a circle to derive N=4, d=3 dual field theories. This reduces dualities for N=4 gauge systems in three dimensions to perturbative symmetries of string theory. Moreover we find that the dual of a gauge system always exists but may or may not correspond to a lagrangian system. In particular we verify a conjecture of Intriligator and Seiberg that an ordinary gauge system is dual to compactification of Exceptional tensionless string theory down to three dimensions. '

I consider cosmological C-metrics and show that the conical singularities in this metric vanish only for three distinct classes of black hole metric, two of which have compact event horizons on each spatial slice. One class is a generalization of the Reissner-Nordstrom (anti) de Sitter black holes in which the event horizons are the direct product of a null line with a 2-surface with topology of genus $g$. The other class consists of neutral black holes whose event horizons are the direct product of a null conoid with a circle. In the presence of a domain wall, black hole pairs of all possible types will be pair created for a wide range of mass and charge, including even negative mass black holes. I determine the relevant instantons and Euclidean actions for each case. Only for spherical are non-static solutions possible. '

Firstly, we present the class of systems and comment on the topological profile of soliton solutions one can find from the first-order equations that solve the equations of motion. After doing that, we follow the standard approach to classical stability to introduce the main steps one needs to obtain the spectra of Schr\"odinger operators that appear in this class of systems. We consider a specific system, from which we illustrate the general calculations and present some analytical results. We also consider another system, more general, and we present another investigation, that introduces new results and offers a comparison with the former investigations. '
9705225;'Supermembranes with Winding';'Bernard de Wit, Kasper Peeters and Jan Plefka';'Wed, 28 May 1997 15:30:36 MDT   (11kb)';'   We study supermembranes in the light-cone gauge in eleven flat dimensions with compact directions. The membrane states are subject to only the central charges associated with closed two-branes, which, in this case, are generated by the winding itself. We present arguments why this winding leaves the mass spectrum continuous. The lower bound on the mass spectrum is set by the winding number and corresponds to a BPS state. '

9705230;'Variational Wave Functionals in Quantum Field Theory';'George Tiktopoulos';'Thu, 29 May 1997 14:22:35 +0300 (EET)   (20kb)';'   Variational (Rayleigh-Ritz) methods are applied to local quantum field theory. For scalar theories the wave functional is parametrized in the form of a superposition of Gaussians and the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is expressed in a form that can be minimized numerically. A scheme of successive refinements of the superposition is proposed that may converge to the exact functional. As an illustration, a simple numerical approximation for the effective potential is worked out based on minimization with respect to five variational parameters. A variational principle is formulated for the fermion vacuum energy as a functional of the scalar fields to which the fermions are coupled. The discussion in this paper is given for scalar and fermion interactions in 1+1 dimensions. The extension to higher dimensions encounters a more involved structure of ultraviolet divergences and is deferred to future work. '
9705231;'Heat Bath Particle Number Spectrum';'Petr Jizba (U.

We show how one can systematically calculate {d<N(\omega)>}/{d\omega} to any order using modified real time finite-temperature diagrams. Our approach is demonstrated on a simple model where two scalar particles scatter, within a photon-electron heat bath, into a pair of charged particles and it is shown how to calculate the resulting changes in the number spectra of the photons and electrons.

It is shown that the role of Drinfeld's doubles play the complexifications of the corresponding compact groups. These complex doubles are used to define the natural actions of the isotropic subgroups forming the doubles on the group manifolds of the N=2 superconformal WZNW models. The Poisson- Lie T-duality in N=2 superconformal U(2)-WZNW model considered in details. It is shown that this model admits Poisson-Lie symmetries with respect to the isotropic subgroups forming Drinfeld's double Gl(2,C). Poisson-Lie T-duality transformation maps this model into itself but acts nontrivialy on the space of classical solutions. Supersymmetric generalization of Poisson-Lie T-duality in N=2 superconformal WZNW models on the compact groups of higher dimensions is proposed. '

We derive all of the fundamental elements of quantum mechanics from the tangent tower structure, including fundamental commutation relations, a Hilbert space of pure and mixed states, measurable expectation values, Schroedinger time evolution, collapse of a state and the probability interpretation. The most central elements of string theory also follow, including an operator valued mode expansion like that in string theory as well as the Virasoro algebra with central charges. '

9705237;'Investigating the BPS Spectrum of Non-Critical E_n Strings';'J.A. Minahan, D. Nemeschansky and N.P. Warner';'Thu, 29 May 1997 17:42:09 MDT   (40kb)';'   We use the effective action of the $E_n$ non-critical strings to study its BPS spectrum for $0 \le n \le 8$. We show how to introduce mass parameters, or Wilson lines, into the effective action, and then perform the appropriate asymptotic expansions that yield the BPS spectrum. The result is the $E_n$ character expansion of the spectrum, and is equivalent to performing the mirror map on a Calabi-Yau with up to nine K\"ahler moduli. This enables a much more detailed examination of the $E_n$ structure of the theory, and provides extensive checks on the effective action description of the non-critical string. We extract some universal ($E_n$ independent) information concerning the degeneracies of BPS excitations. '

This method was first developed by Borcea and Voisin. We examined their properties torically and checked mirror symmetry for Calabi-Yau 4-fold case.

This approximate nonrenormalization can explain the agreement between the perturbative degeneracy of these states and the Sen entropy of the associated black holes. '

We also consider WZNW models for $SL(2,R)$, and for SU(2) at level 0, in which we find logarithmic operators which form Jordan blocks for the current as well as the Virasoro algebra. '
9705241;'Oriented Open-Closed String Theory Revisited';'Barton Zwiebach';'Fri, 30 May 1997 12:08:21 -0400 (EDT)   (309kb)';'   String theory on D-brane backgrounds is open-closed string theory. Given the relevance of this fact, we give details and elaborate upon our earlier construction of oriented open-closed string field theory. In order to incorporate explicitly closed strings, the classical sector of this theory is open strings with a homotopy associative A_\infty algebraic structure. We build a suitable Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra on moduli spaces of bordered Riemann surfaces, the construction of which involves a few subtleties arising from the open string punctures and cyclicity conditions. All vertices coupling open and closed strings through disks are described explicitly. Subalgebras of the algebra of surfaces with boundaries are used to discuss symmetries of classical open string theory induced by the closed string sector, and to write classical open string field theory on general closed string backgrounds. We give a preliminary analysis of the ghost-dilaton theorem. '

These massless states have constant wavefunctions in momentum space and are therefore fundamental excitations of the theory. '
9705243;'The phases of two-dimensional QED and QCD';'Roya Mohayaee';'Fri, 30 May 1997 19:21:39 -0300 (EST)   (7kb)';'   The semi-classical phase structure of two-dimensional QED and QCD are briefly reviewed. The non-abelian theory is reformulated to closely resemble the Schwinger model. It is shown that, contrary to the abelian theory, the phase structure of two-dimensional QCD is unaffected by the structure of the theta vacuum. We make parallel calculations in the two theories and conclude that massless Schwinger model is in the screening and the massive theory is in the confining phase, whereas both massless and massive QCD are in the screening phase.

Love (Royal';'Sat, 31 May 97 00:31 BST   (431kb)';'   The possibility of spontaneous breaking of CP symmetry by the expectation values of orbifold moduli is investigated with particular reference to $CP$ violating phases in soft supersymmetry breaking terms. The effect of different mechanisms for stabilizing the dilaton and the form of the non-perturbative superpotential on the existence and size of these phases is studied. Non-perturbative superpotentials involving the absolute modular invariant $j(T)$, such as may arise from F-theory compactifications, are considered. '

The possible relevance of this result for superstring inspired cosmological models is discussed. Particular attention will be paid to the connection between Faraday rotation signals and stochastic gravity-wave backgrounds. '
9706202;'The Ostrogradsky Method for Local Symmetries. Constrained Theories with';'N.P.Chitaia, S.A.Gogilidze and Yu.S.Surovtsev';'Fri, 27 Jun 97 20:20:25 +0300 (MSK)   (8kb)';'   In the generalized Hamiltonian formalism by Dirac, the method of constructing the generator of local-symmetry transformations for systems with first- and second-class constraints (without restrictions on the algebra of constraints) is obtained from the requirement for them to map the solutions of the Hamiltonian equations of motion into the solutions of the same equations. It is proved that second-class constraints do not contribute to the transformation law of the local symmetry entirely stipulated by all the first-class constraints (and only by them). A mechanism of occurrence of higher derivatives of coordinates and group parameters in the symmetry transformation law in the Noether second theorem is elucidated. It is shown that the obtained transformations of symmetry are canonical in the extended (by Ostrogradsky) phase space. An application of the method in theories with higher derivatives is demonstrated with an example of the spinor Christ -- Lee model. '
9706203;'Semi-classical spectrum of the Homogeneous sine-Gordon theories';'C.R. Fern\'andez-Pousa and J.L. Miramontes';'Fri, 27 Jun 97 20:54:32 +0200   (35kb)';'   The semi-classical spectrum of the Homogeneous sine-Gordon theories associated with an arbitrary compact simple Lie group G is obtained and shown to be entirely given by solitons. These theories describe quantum integrable massive perturbations of Gepner's G-parafermions whose classical equations-of-motion are non-abelian affine Toda equations. One-soliton solutions are constructed by embeddings of the SU(2) complex sine-Gordon soliton in the regular SU(2) subgroups of G. The resulting spectrum exhibits both stable and unstable particles, which is a peculiar feature shared with the spectrum of monopoles and dyons in N=2 and N=4 supersymmetric gauge theories. '
9706204;'Absorption of Scalars by Extended Objects';'Roberto Emparan';'Fri, 27 Jun 1997 16:15:34 -0700 (PDT)   (18kb)';'   We derive the low energy absorption cross section of minimal scalars for a very generic class of geometries, that includes, among others, black holes, strings, $p$-branes, as well as intersecting brane configurations. The scalar field can be absorbed across a regular surface (a horizon) of finite area, or across a zero area throat, which may be singular or regular. Then we focus on some particular cases and compare with the results obtained using microscopic models at weak coupling. Exact agreement is found for the absorption by the non-degenerate ground state of effective strings. For geometries where the throat is singular, we show that absorption through the stretched horizon yields correct results for degenerate states. For non-degenerate (ground) states we introduce a stretched throat, and show that it accounts for the correct dependence on frequency, charges, and moduli for the absorption by ground states of BPS fundamental strings. It is also shown to lead to the correct dependence on frequency for extremal D-branes. '
9706206;'Bogomol'nyi equations in gauge theories';'M.S. Cunha, H.R. Christiansen and C. A. S. Almeida';'Fri, 27 Jun 1997 17:20:45 -0300   (56kb)';'   By imposing self-duality conditions, we obtain the explicit form in which gauge theories spontaneously breakdown in the Bogomol'nyi limit. In this context, we reconsider the Abelian Higgs, Chern-Simons Higgs and Maxwell-Chern-Simons Higgs models. On the same footing, we find a topological Higgs potential for a Maxwell-Chern-Simons extended theory presenting both minimal and nonminimal coupling. Finally, we perform a numerical calculation in the asymmetric phase and show the solutions to the self-dual equations of motion of the topological theory. We argue about certain relations among the parameters of the model in order to obtain such vortex configurations. '

We interpret the simplification in the pattern of N-body interactions that he observed in terms of the recent picture of black holes in four and five dimensions as composites, made up of intersecting branes. We then show that the geometry of the moduli space of a class of black holes in five and nine dimensions is hyper-K\"ahler with torsion, and octonionic-K\"ahler with torsion, respectively. For this, we examine the geometry of point particle models with extended world-line supersymmetry and show that both of the above geometries arise naturally in this context. In addition, we construct a large class of hyper-K\"ahler with torsion and octonionic-K\"ahler with torsion geometries in various dimensions. We also present a brane interpretation of our results. '
9706208;'SL(2,Z) duality of Born-Infeld theory from self-dual electrodynamics in';'D.S.Berman';'Fri, 27 Jun 1997 23:25:22 +0200 (MET DST)   (9kb)';'   We reformulate the Born-Infeld action, coupled to an axion and a dilaton in a duality manifest way. This action is the generalization of the Schwarz-Sen action for non-linear electrodynamics. We show that this action may be obtained by dimensional reduction on a torus of a self-dual theory in 6 dimensions. The dilaton-axion being identified with the complex structure of the torus. Applications to M-theory and the self-dual IIB three brane are investigated. '
9706209;'String Without Strings';'James T. Wheeler';'Fri, 27 Jun 1997 17:02:22 -0600   (48kb)';'   Scale invariance provides a principled reason for the physical importance of Hilbert space, the Virasoro algebra, the string mode expansion, canonical commutators and Schroedinger evolution of states, independent of the assumptions of string theory and quantum theory. The usual properties of dimensionful fields imply an infinite, projective tower of conformal weights associated with the tangent space to scale-invariant spacetimes. Convergence and measurability on this tangent tower are guaranteed using a scale-invariant norm, restricted to conformally self-dual vectors. Maps on the resulting Hilbert space are correspondingly restricted to semi-definite conformal weight. We find the maximally- and minimally-commuting, complete Lie algebras of definite-weight operators. The projective symmetry of the tower gives these algebras central charges, giving the canonical commutator and quantum Virasoro algebras, respectively. Using a continuous, m-parameter representation for rank-m tower tensors, we show that the parallel transport equation for the momentum vector of a particle is the Schroedinger equation, while the associated definite-weight operators obey canonical commutation relations. Generalizing to the set of integral curves of general timelike, self-dual vector-valued weight maps gives a lifting such that the action of the curves parallel transports arbitrary tower vectors. We prove that the full set of Schroedinger-lifted integral curves of a general self-dual map gives an immersion of its 2-dim parameter space into spacetime, inducing a Lorentzian metric on the parameter space. The immersion is shown to satisfy the variational equations of open string. '
9706210;'Duality and Global Symmetries';'Fernando Quevedo';'27 Jun 1997 22:38:03 -0000   (31kb)';'   This is a general introduction to duality in field theories. The existence and breaking of global symmetries is used as a guideline to systematically prove duality between different field theories. Systems discussed include abelian and non-abelian T-duality in string theory, abelian and nonabelian bosonization, and duality for massless and massive antisymmetric tensor field theories in arbitrary number of dimensions. Open questions regarding these techniques are also discussed. (Lectures given at 33rd Karpacz Winter School `Duality: Strings and Fields' .) '

In particular, we discuss the effective field theory of six- and four-dimensional compactifications with N>1 supersymmetries. We then describe various duality tests by comparing gauge couplings, N=2 prepotentials, as well as higher-derivative F-terms. Based on invited lectures delivered at: 33rd Karpacz Winter School of Theoretical Physics ``Duality, Strings and Fields,'' Przesieka, Poland, 13 - 22 February 1997; Trieste Conference on Duality Symmetries in String Theory, Trieste, Italy, 1 - 4 April 1997; Cargese Summer School ``Strings, Branes and Dualities,'' Cargese, France, 26 May - 14 June 1997.

9706212;'Renormalization of Hamiltonians in the Light-Front Fock Space';'Stanislaw D. Glazek (Institute of Theoretical Physics, Warsaw';'Sun, 29 Jun 97 02:10:42 +0200   (81kb)';'   We outline an ultraviolet renormalization procedure for hamiltonians acting in the light-front Fock space. The hamiltonians are defined and calculated using creation and annihilation operators with no limitation of the space of states. Both, the regularization of the initial hamiltonian and the definition of the renormalized effective hamiltonians, preserve the light-front frame kinematical symmetries. The general equations for the effective hamiltonians are illustrated by second order calculations of the self-energy and two-particle interaction terms in Yukawa theory, QED and QCD. Infrared singularities are regulated but not renormalized. '
9706213;'On Nonlocality, Lattices and Internal Symmetries';'A. Kempf';'Sat, 28 Jun 1997 18:21:50 MDT   (7kb)';'   We study functional analytic aspects of two types of correction terms to the Heisenberg algebra. One type is known to induce a finite lower bound $\Delta x_0$ to the resolution of distances, a short distance cutoff which is motivated from string theory and quantum gravity. It implies the existence of families of self-adjoint extensions of the position operators with lattices of eigenvalues. These lattices, which form representations of certain unitary groups cannot be resolved on the given geometry. This leads us to conjecture that, within this framework, degrees of freedom that correspond to structure smaller than the resolvable (Planck) scale turn into internal degrees of freedom with these unitary groups as symmetries. The second type of correction terms is related to the previous essentially by "Wick rotation", and its basics are here considered for the first time. In particular, we investigate unitarily inequivalent representations. '
9706214;'New Conformal Gauging and the Electromagnetic Theory of Weyl';'James T. Wheeler';'Sun, 29 Jun 1997 17:28:08 -0600   (33kb)';'   A new 8-dim conformal gauging solves the auxiliary field problem and eliminates unphysical size change from Weyl's electromagnetic theory. We derive the Maurer-Cartan structure equations and find the zero curvature solutions for the conformal connection. By showing that every one-particle Hamiltonian generates the structure equations we establish a correspondence between phase space and the 8-dim base space, and between the action and the integral of the Weyl vector. Applying the correspondence to generic flat solutions yields the Lorentz force law, the form and gauge dependence of the electromagnetic vector potential and minimal coupling. The dynamics found for these flat solutions applies locally in generic spaces. We then provide necessary and sufficient curvature constraints for general curved 8-dimensional geometries to be in 1-1 correspondence with 4-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell spacetimes, based on a vector space isomorphism between the extra four dimensions and the Riemannian tangent space. Despite part of the Weyl vector serving as the electromagnetic vector potential, the entire class of geometries has vanishing dilation, thereby providing a consistent unified geometric theory of gravitation and electromagnetism. In concluding, we discuss the observability of the extra dimensions. '
9706215;'Normal Biconformal Spaces';'James T. Wheeler';'Sun, 29 Jun 1997 17:55:43 -0600   (26kb)';'   A new 8-dimensional conformal gauging avoids the unphysical size change, third order gravitational field equations, and auxiliary fields that prevent taking the conformal group as a fundamental symmetry. We give the structure equations, gauge transformations and intrinsic metric structure for the new biconformal spaces. We prove that a torsion-free biconformal space with exact Weyl form, closed dilational curvature and trace-free spacetime curvature admits a sub-bundle of vanishing Weyl form homeomorphic to the Whitney sum bundle of the tangent bundle and the bundle of orthonormal Lorentz frames over 4-dimensional spacetime. Conversely, any 4-dimensional spacetime extends uniquely to such a normal biconformal space. The Einstein equation holds if and only if the biconformal basis is orthonormal. Unconstrained antisymmetric trace of the spacetime curvature provides a closed 2-form, independent of the Weyl vector, consistently interpretable as the electromagnetic field. The trace of the spacetime co-torsion decouples from gravitational sources and serves as electromagnetic source. '
9706216;'A Two-Form Formulation of the Vector-Tensor Multiplet in Central Charge';'Ioseph Buchbinder, Ahmed Hindawi, and Burt A.

The N=2 non-Abelian standard supergauge multiplet in central charge superspace is also discussed, as is with the associated Chern-Simons form. We give the constraints, solve the Bianchi identities and present the action for a theory of the vector-tensor multiplet coupled to the non-Abelian supergauge multiplet via the Chern-Simons form. '

Veselov';'Mon, 30 Jun 1997 14:13:33 EET   (22kb)';'   We study the domain walls connecting different chirally asymmetric vacua in supersymmetric QCD. We show that BPS - saturated solutions exist only in the limited range of mass. When m exceeds some critical value, the domain wall either ceases to be BPS - saturated or disappears altogether. In any case, the properties of the system are qualitatively changed. '

Troost';'Mon, 30 Jun 97 13:05:36 WETDST   (10kb)';'   We consider a general N=(2,2) non-linear sigma-model in (2,2) superspace. Depending on the details of the complex structures involved, an off-shell description can be given in terms of chiral, twisted chiral and semi-chiral superfields. Using superspace techniques, we derive the conditions the potential has to satisfy in order to be ultra-violet finite at one loop. We pay particular attention to the effects due to the presence of semi-chiral superfields. A complete description of N=(2,2) strings follows from this. '
9706219;'Low Energy Theorems in N=1 Supersymmetric Theory';'Kiyoshi Higashijima, Muneto Nitta, Kazutoshi Ohta and Nobuyoshi Ohta';'Mon, 30 Jun 97 20:08:55 +0900   (19kb)';'   In N=1 supersymmetric theories, quasi Nambu-Goldstone (QNG) bosons appear in addition to ordinary Nambu-Goldstone (NG) bosons when the global symmetry G breaks down spontaneously. We investigate two-body scattering amplitudes of these bosons in the low-energy effective Lagrangian formalism. They are expressed by the curvature of Kahler manifold. The scattering amplitudes of QNG bosons are shown to coincide with those of NG bosons though the effective Lagrangian contains an arbitrary function, and those with odd number of QNG bosons all vanish.

9706220;'Reduced phase space quantization of massive vector theory';'H.-P. Pavel and V.N. Pervushin';'Mon, 30 Jun 97 15:17:50 +0200   (16kb)';'   We quantize massive vector theory in such a way that it has a well-defined massless limit. In contrast to the approach by St\"uckelberg where ghost fields are introduced to maintain manifest Lorentz covariance, we use reduced phase space quantization with nonlocal dynamical variables which in the massless limit smoothly turn into the photons, and check explicitly that the Poincare algebra is fullfilled. In contrast to conventional covariant quantization our approach leads to a propagator which has no singularity in the massless limit and is well behaved for large momenta. For massive QED, where the vector field is coupled to a conserved fermion current, the quantum theory of the nonlocal vector fields is shown to be equivalent to that of the standard local vector fields. An inequivalent theory, however, is obtained when the reduced nonlocal massive vector field is coupled to a nonconserved classical current. '

Veneziano';'Mon, 30 Jun 1997 18:20:28 +0200 (MET DST)   (30kb)';'   We generalize previous work on inhomogeneous pre-big bang cosmology by including the effect of non-trivial moduli and antisymmetric-tensor/axion fields. The general quasi-homogeneous asymptotic solution---as one approaches the big bang singularity from perturbative initial data---is given and its range of validity is discussed, allowing us to give a general quantitative estimate of the amount of inflation obtained during the perturbative pre-big bang era. The question of determining early-time ``attractors'' for generic pre-big bang cosmologies is also addressed, and a motivated conjecture is advanced. We also discuss S-duality-related features of the solutions, and speculate on the way an asymptotic T-duality symmetry may act on moduli space as one approaches the big bang. '
9706222;'Confinement in Covariant Gauges';'Martin Schaden, Alexander Rozenberg (New York University)';'Mon, 30 Jun 1997 12:20:53 -0400   (77kb)';'   We examine the weak coupling limit of Euclidean SU(n) gauge theory in covariant gauges. Following an earlier suggestion, an equivariant BRST-construction is used to define the continuum theory on a finite torus. The equivariant gauge fixing introduces constant ghost fields as moduli of the model. We study the parameter- and moduli- space perturbatively. For $n_f \leq n$ quark flavors, the moduli flow to a non-trivial fixed point in certain critical covariant gauges and the one-loop effective potential indicates that the global SU(n) color symmetry of the gauge fixed model is spontaneously broken to $U(1)^{n-1}$. Ward identities and renormalization group arguments imply that the longitudinal gauge boson propagator at long range is dominated by $n(n-1)$ Goldstone bosons in these critical covariant gauges. In the large $n$ limit, we derive a nonlinear integral equation for the expectation value of large Wilson loops assuming that the exchange of Goldstone bosons dominates the interaction at long range in critical covariant gauges. We find numerically that the expectation value of large circular Wilson loops decreases exponentially with the enclosed area in the absence of dynamical fermions. The gauge invariance of this mechanism for confinement in critical covariant gauges is discussed. '
9706223;'Large N WZW Field Theory Of N=2 Strings';'A. Jevicki, M. Mihailescu and J. P. Nunes';'Mon, 30 Jun 1997 16:43:32 -0400   (12kb)';'   We explore the quantum properties of self-dual gravity formulated as a large $N$ two-dimensional WZW sigma model. Using a non-trivial classical background, we show that a $(2,2)$ space-time is generated. The theory contains an infinite series of higher point vertices. At tree level we show that, in spite of the presence of higher than cubic vertices, the on-shell 4 and higher point functions vanish, indicating that this model is related with the field theory of closed N=2 strings. We examine the one-loop on-shell 3-point amplitude and show that it is ultra-violet finite. '

9706225;'Euclidean SYM Theories by Time Reduction and Special Holonomy Manifolds';'Matthias Blau, George Thompson';'Mon, 30 Jun 1997 23:47:20 +0200 (MET DST)   (19kb)';'   Euclidean supersymmetric theories are obtained from Minkowskian theories by performing a reduction in the time direction. This procedure elucidates certain mysterious features of Zumino's N=2 model in four dimensions, provides manifestly hermitian Euclidean counterparts of all non-mimimal SYM theories, and is also applicable to supergravity theories. We reanalyse the twists of the 4d N=2 and N=4 models from this point of view. Other applications include SYM theories on special holonomy manifolds. In particular, we construct a twisted SYM theory on Kaehler 3-folds and clarify the structure of SYM theory on hyper-Kaehler 4-folds. '
9706226;'F-theory, SO(32) and Toric Geometry';'Philip Candelas and Harald Skarke';'Mon, 30 Jun 1997 17:59:07 -0500 (CDT)   (16kb)';'   We show that the F-theory dual of the heterotic string with unbroken Spin(32)/Z_2 symmetry in eight dimensions can be described in terms of the same polyhedron that can also encode unbroken E_8\times E_8 symmetry. By considering particular compactifications with this K3 surface as a fiber, we can reproduce the recently found `record gauge group' in six dimensions and obtain a new `record gauge group' in four dimensions. Our observations relate to the toric diagram for the intersection of components of degenerate fibers and our definition of these objects, which we call `tops', is more general than an earlier definition by Candelas and Font.

9707201;'New Tetrads for General Relativity';'G. Bimonte, R. Musto, A. Stern and P. Vitale';'Thu, 24 Jul 1997 15:25:12 +0200 (MET DST)   (14kb)';'   Using the tools of q--differential calculus and quantum Lie algebras associated to quantum groups, we find a one--parameter family of q-gauge theories associated to the quantum group $ISO_q(3,1)$. Although the gauge fields, that is the spin--connection and the vierbeins are non--commuting objects depending on a deformation parameter, $q$, it is possible to construct out of them a metric theory which is insensitive to the deformation. The Christoffel symbols and the Riemann tensor are ordinary commuting objects. Hence it is argued that torsionless Einstein's General Relativity is the common invariant sector of a one--parameter family of deformed gauge theories. '
9707202;'Duality Symmetries and Noncommutative Geometry of String Spacetime';'F. Lizzi and R.J. Szabo (Oxford)';'Thu, 24 Jul 1997 12:00:30 +0100 (BST)   (65kb)';'   We examine the structure of spacetime symmetries of toroidally compactified string theory within the framework of noncommutative geometry. Following a proposal of Frohlich and Gawedzki, we describe the noncommutative string spacetime using a detailed algebraic construction of the vertex operator algebra. We show that the spacetime duality and discrete worldsheet symmetries of the string theory are a consequence of the existence of two independent Dirac operators, arising from the chiral structure of the conformal field theory. We demonstrate that these Dirac operators are also responsible for the emergence of ordinary classical spacetime as a low-energy limit of the string spacetime, and from this we establish a relationship between T-duality and changes of spin structure of the target space manifold. We study the automorphism group of the vertex operator algebra and show that spacetime duality is naturally a gauge symmetry in this formalism. We show that classical general covariance also becomes a gauge symmetry of the string spacetime. We explore some larger symmetries of the algebra in the context of a universal gauge group for string theory, and connect these symmetry groups with some of the algebraic structures which arise in the mathematical theory of vertex operator algebras, such as the Monster group. We also briefly describe how the classical topology of spacetime is modified by the string theory, and calculate the cohomology groups of the noncommutative spacetime. A self-contained, pedagogical introduction to the techniques of noncommmutative geometry is also included. '

In all these theories duality symmetries are related to the notion of "flat symplectic bundles" and central charges may be defined as "sections" over these bundles. Attractor points giving rise to "fixed scalars" of the horizon geometry and Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for extremal black-holes are discussed in some details. '

Banerjee and C.Wotzasek';'Thu, 24 Jul 1997 11:28:16 -0300   (11kb)';'   We show in a precise way, either in the fermionic or its bosonized version, that Bose symmetry provides a systematic way to carry out the chiral decomposition of the two dimensional fermionic determinant. Interpreted properly, we show that there is no obstruction of this decomposition to gauge invariance, as is usually claimed. Finally, a new way of interpreting the Polyakov-Wiegman identity is proposed. '
9707205;'D-brane Analyses for BPS Mass Spectra and U-duality';'Yuji Sugawara, Katsuyuki Sugiyama';'Fri, 25 Jul 1997 00:10:59 +0900   (44kb)';'   We give a confirmation of U-duality of type II superstring by discussing mass spectrum of the BPS states. We first evaluate the mass spectrum of BPS solitons with one kind of R-R charges. Our analysis is based on the 1-loop effective action of D-brane, which is known as ``Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action'', and the fact that BPS states correspond to the SUSY cycles with minimal volumes. We show the mass formula derived in this manner is completely fitted with that given by U-duality. We further discuss the cases of BPS solitons possessing several kinds of R-R charges. These are cases of ``intersecting D-branes'', which cannot be described by simple DBI actions. We claim that, in these cases, higher loop corrections should be incorporated as binding energies between the branes. It is remarkable that the summation of the contributions from all loops reproduces the correct mass formula predicted by U-duality. '
9707206;'Analytic Continuation of Operators -- operators acting complex s-times';'S. C. Woon (DAMTP, Cambridge)';'Thu, 24 Jul 1997 15:40:10 MDT   (97kb)';'   We are used to thinking of an operator acting once, twice, and so on. However, an operator acting integer times can be consistently analytic continued to an operator acting complex times. Applications: (s,r) diagrams and an extension of Fractional Calculus where commutativity of fractional derivatives is preserved, generating integrals and non-standard derivations of theorems in Number Theory, non-integer power series and breaking of Leibniz and Chain rules, pseudo-groups and symmetry deforming models in particle physics and cosmology, non-local effect in analytic continued matrix representations, particle-physics-like scatterings of zeros of analytic continued Bernoulli polynomials (physics/9705021), analytic continuation of operators in QM, QFT and Strings.

9707207;'Spectrum-generating Symmetries for BPS Solitons';'E. Cremmer, H. Lu, C.N. Pope and K.S. Stelle';'Thu, 24 Jul 1997 12:02:27 -0500   (28kb)';'   We show that there exist nonlinearly realised duality symmetries that are independent of the standard supergravity global symmetries, and which provide active spectrum-generating symmetries for the fundamental BPS solitons. The additional ingredient, in any spacetime dimension, is a single scaling transformation that allows one to map between BPS solitons with different masses. Without the inclusion of this additional transformation, which is a symmetry of the classical equations of motion, but not the action, it is not possible to find a spectrum-generating symmetry. The necessity of including this scaling transformation highlights the vulnerability of duality multiplets to quantum anomalies. We argue that fundamental BPS solitons may be immune to this threat. '
9707208;'On the M-theory description of gaugino condensation';'I. Antoniadis and M. Quiros';'Thu, 24 Jul 1997 19:38:58 +0200   (13kb)';'   We present an additional test of the recent proposal for describing supersymmetry breaking due to gaugino condensation in the strong coupling regime, by a Scherk-Schwarz mechanism on the eleventh dimension of M-theory. An analysis of supersymmetric transformations in the infinite-radius limit reveals the presence of a discontinuity in the spinorial parameter, which coincides with the result found in the presence of gaugino condensation. The condensate is then identified with the quantized parameter entering the modification of the Scherk-Schwarz boundary conditions. This mechanism provides an alternative perturbative explanation of the gauge hierarchy that determines the scale of low-energy supersymmetry breaking in terms of the unification gauge coupling '

9707211;'The Even and the Odd Spectral Flows on the N=2 Superconformal Algebras';'Beatriz Gato-Rivera';'Thu, 24 Jul 1997 22:03:48 +0200   (14kb)';'   There are two different spectral flows on the N=2 superconformal algebras (four in the case of the Topological algebra). The usual spectral flow, first considered by Schwimmer and Seiberg, is an even transformation, whereas the spectral flow previously considered by the author and Rosado is an odd transformation. We show that the even spectral flow is generated by the odd spectral flow, and therefore only the latter is fundamental. We also analyze thoroughly the four ``topological'' spectral flows, writing two of them here for the first time. Whereas the even and the odd spectral flows have quasi-mirrored properties acting on the Antiperiodic or the Periodic algebras, the topological even and odd spectral flows have drastically different properties acting on the Topological algebra. The other two topological spectral flows have mixed even and odd properties. We show that the even and the even-odd topological spectral flows are generated by the odd and the odd-even topological spectral flows, and therefore only the latter are fundamental. '

In the simplest procedure --- starting with a flat ``seed'' metric on the covering space --- we find that the resulting D-brane metric is not Ricci-flat. We argue that this is likely to be true of the true 0-brane metric at weak string coupling. '
9707215;'Superstrings with new supersymmetry in (9,2) and (10,2) dimensions';'Itzhak Bars and Cemsinan Deliduman';'Fri, 25 Jul 97 12:46:39 +0200   (16kb)';'   We construct superstring theories that obey the new supersymmetry algebra {Q_a , Q_b}=\gamma_{ab}^{mn} P_{1m} P_{2n}, in a Green-Schwarz formalism, with kappa supersymmetry also of the new type. The superstring is in a system with a superparticle so that their total momenta are $P_{2n},P_{1m}$ respectively. The system is covariant and critical in (10,2) dimensions if the particle is massless and in (9,2) dimensions if the particle is massive. Both the superstring and superparticle have coordinates with two timelike dimensions but each behaves effectively as if they have a single timelike dimension. This is due to gauge symmetries and associated constraints. We show how to generalize the gauge principle to more intricate systems containing two parts, 1 and 2. Each part contains interacting constituents, such as p-branes, and each part behaves effectively as if they have one timelike coordinate, although the full system has two timelike coordinates. The examples of two superparticles, and of a superparticle and a superstring, discussed in more detail are a special cases of such a generalized interacting system. '
9707216;'Kinematics and uncertainty relations of a quantum test particle in a';'P. Kuusk, J. Ord';'Fri, 25 Jul 1997 06:17:56 MDT   (7kb)';'   A possible model for quantum kinematics of a test particle in a curved space-time is proposed. Every reasonable neighbourhood V_e of a curved space-time can be equipped with a nonassociative binary operation called the geodesic multiplication of space-time points. In the case of the Minkowski space-time, left and right translations of the geodesic multiplication coincide and amount to a rigid shift of the space-time x->x+a. In a curved space-time infinitesimal geodesic right translations can be used to define the (geodesic) momentum operators. The commutation relations of position and momentum operators are taken as the quantum kinematic algebra. As an example, detailed calculations are performed for the space-time of a weak plane gravitational wave. The uncertainty relations following from the commutation rules are derived and their physical meaning is discussed. '

The corresponding states have well defined helicity and handedness. It is shown that spinors and gauge bosons of the same handedness only interact. '
9707221;'Quantum Fields at Any Time';'C. G. Torre (Utah State U.) and M. Varadarajan (Raman Research';'Fri, 25 Jul 1997 10:03:49 -0600 (MDT)   (27kb)';'   The canonical quantum theory of a free field using arbitrary foliations of a flat two-dimensional spacetime is investigated. It is shown that dynamical evolution along arbitrary spacelike foliations is unitarily implemented on the same Fock space as that associated with inertial foliations. It follows that the Schrodinger picture exists for arbitrary foliations as a unitary image of the Heisenberg picture for the theory. An explicit construction of the Schrodinger picture image of the Heisenberg Fock space states is provided. The results presented here can be interpreted in terms of a Dirac constraint quantization of parametrized field theory. In particular, it is shown that the Schrodinger picture physical states satisfy a functional Schrodinger equation which includes a slice-dependent c-number quantum correction, in accord with a proposal of Kuchar. The spatial diffeomorphism invariance of the Schrodinger picture physical states is established. Fundamental difficulties arise when trying to generalize these results to higher-dimensional spacetimes. '
9707222;'Calculable e^{-1/\lambda} Effects';'I. Antoniadis, B. Pioline and T.R. Taylor';'Fri, 25 Jul 1997 10:59:08 MDT   (21kb)';'   We identify and evaluate a class of physical amplitudes in four-dimensional N=4 superstring theory, which receive, in the weak coupling limit, contributions of order e^{-1/\lambda}, where \lambda is the type II superstring coupling constant. They correspond to four-derivative \Ftilde_1 interaction terms involving the universal type II dilaton supermultiplet. The exact result, obtained by means of a one-loop computation in the dual heterotic theory compactified on T^6, is compared with the perturbation theory on the type II side, and the e^{-1/\lambda} contributions are associated to non-perturbative effects of Euclidean solitons (D-branes) wrapped on K3 x T^2. The ten-dimensional decompactification limit on the type IIB side validates the recent conjecture for the D-instanton-induced R^4 couplings. '
9707223;'Gaugino Condensation, Moduli Potentials and Supersymmetry Breaking in';'Zygmunt Lalak and Steven Thomas';'Fri, 25 Jul 1997 17:59:37 MDT   (21kb)';'   We derive the explicit form, and discuss some properties of the moduli dependent effective potential arising from M-theory compactified on $M_4 \times X\times S^1 / Z_2 $, when one of the boundaries supports a strongly interacting gauge sector and induces gaugino condensation. We discuss the relation between the explicit gaugino condensate and effective superpotential formulations and find interesting differences with respect to the situation known from the weakly coupled heterotic string case. The moduli dependence of the effective potential turns out to be more complicated than expected, and perhaps offers new clues to the stabilization problem. '
9707224;'Gravitational Couplings and $Z_2$ Orientifolds';'Keshav Dasgupta, Dileep P. Jatkar, Sunil Mukhi';'Sun, 27 Jul 1997 15:20:13 +0530   (21kb)';'   The interplay between gravitational couplings on branes and the occurrence of fractional flux in low dimensional orientifolds is examined. It is argued that gravitational couplings need to be assigned not only to D-branes but also to orientifold planes. The fractional charges of the orientifold $d$-planes can be understood in terms of flux quantization of the $d-3$ form potential and modified Bianchi identities. Detailed results are presented for the case of the type IIB orientifold on $T^6/Z_2$, which is dual to F-theory on a complex 4-fold with terminal singularities. '
9707225;'Wrapped M-branes and Three-dimensional Topologies';'Christof Schmidhuber';'Mon, 28 Jul 1997 08:38:47 +0200   (23kb)';'   The three-dimensional topologies of the membrane of M-theory can be constructed by performing Dehn surgery along knot lines. We investigate membranes wrapped around a circle and the correponding subset of topologies (Seifert manifolds). The knot lines are interpreted as magnetic flux tubes in an XY model coupled to Maxwell theory. In this model the eleventh dimension of M-theory gets ``eaten'' by the world-brane metric. There is argued to be a second-order phase transition at a critical value of the string coupling constant. The topology fluctuations that correspond to the knot lines are irrelevant in one phase while they condense in the other phase. '

Guerrero';'Mon, 28 Jul 1997 13:27:10 +0200 (MET DST)   (23kb)';'   The algebra of linear and quadratic functions of basic observables on the phase space of either the free particle or the harmonic oscillator possesses a finite-dimensional anomaly. The quantization of these systems outside the critical values of the anomaly leads to a new degree of freedom which shares its internal character with spin, but nevertheless features an infinite number of different states. Both are associated with the transformation properties of wave functions under the Weyl-symplectic group $WSp(6,\Re)$. The physical meaning of this new degree of freedom can be established, with a major scope, only by analysing the quantization of an infinite-dimensional algebra of diffeomorphisms generalizing string symmetry and leading to more general extended objects.

This shows that lattice discretization technique could be a useful tool for the numerical solution of scattering problems in general. The approach is illustrated in the case of the Dirac delta function potential. '
9707232;'Hyperk\"ahler Manifolds and Multiply Intersecting Branes';'G. W.

We showed how to construct hyper-K\"ahler 8-metrics in terms of arrangements of three-dimensional hyperplanes in six-dimensional euclidean space. The slopes of the planes define two relatively prime integers $(p,q)$. Under reduction to ten dimensions and T-duality we get a geometric picture of the action of $SL(2,Z)$ on the $(NS \otimes NS,q R \otimes R)$ 5-branes of type IIB string theory. Configurations are exhibited with $3 \over 16$'th SUSY. '
9707233;'Colliding Axion-Dilaton Plane Waves from Black Holes';'Patricia Schwarz';'Mon, 28 Jul 1997 17:37:40 MDT   (348kb)';'   The colliding plane wave metric discovered by Ferrari and Iba\~{n}ez to be locally isometric to the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole is extended to the case of general axion-dilaton black holes. Because the transformation maps either black hole horizon to the focal plane of the colliding waves, this entire class of colliding plane wave spacetimes only suffers from the formation of spacetime singularities in the limits where the inner horizon itself is singular, which occur in the Schwarzschild and dilaton black hole limits. The supersymmetric limit corresponding to the extreme axion-dilaton black hole yields the Bertotti-Robinson metric with the axion and dilaton fields flowing to fixed constant values. The maximal analytic extension of this metric across the Cauchy horizon yields a spacetime in which two sandwich waves in a cylindrical universe collide to produce a semi-infinite chain of Reissner-Nordstrom-like wormholes. The focussing of particle and string geodesics in this spacetime is explored. '

After presenting recent attempts to improve the variational approximation, we introduce a new systematic method based on the background field method, which enables one to compute the order-by-order correction terms to the Gaussian approximation of the effective action.

It is pointed out that results obtained by Ghoshal for the sine-Gordon breather reflection factors suggest an interesting dual relationship between models with different boundary conditions. Ghoshal's formula for the lightest breather is checked perturbatively to $O(\beta^2)$ in the special set of cases in which the $\phi\to -\phi$ symmetry is maintained. It is noted that the parametrisation of the boundary potential which is natural for the semi-classical approximation also provides a good parametrisation at the `free-fermion' point. '
9707236;'N = 1, D = 6 Supergravity: Duality and non Minimal Couplings';'Gianguido Dall'Agata and Kurt Lechner';'Tue, 29 Jul 1997 13:19:34 +0100   (25kb)';'   In this paper we present a superspace formulation of $N = 1, D = 6$ supergravity with one tensor-multiplet and an arbitrary number of vector- and hypermultiplets, in which the bosonic abelian superforms of the theory, the dilaton, the abelian gauge fields and the two-form are replaced by their S-duals i.e. four, three and two-superforms respectively, in compatibility with supersymmetry. As usual this replacement interchanges Bianchi identities with equations of motion. This formulation holds in the presence of one tensor multiplet and arbitrary numbers of hypermultiplets and abelian super-Maxwell multiplets if all couplings are minimal. We determine the consistency conditions for non-minimal couplings in $N = 1$, $D = 6$ supergravity, for which we present a particularly significant solution, namely the one associated with the Chern-Simons-Lorentz three-form which entails the Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism. In the case of non minimal couplings it is found that the gauge fields and the two-form can still be dualized while the dilaton has to remain a zero-form. '
9707237;'Modular Invariance on the Torus and Abelian Chern-Simons Theory';'J. Guerrero, M. Calixto and V. Aldaya';'Tue, 29 Jul 1997 13:17:55 +0200 (MET DST)   (27kb)';'   The implementation of modular invariance on the torus as a phase space at the quantum level is discussed in a group-theoretical framework. Unlike the classical case, at the quantum level some restrictions on the parameters of the theory should be imposed to ensure modular invariance. Two cases must be considered, depending on the cohomology class of the symplectic form on the torus. If it is of integer cohomology class $n$, then full modular invariance is achieved at the quantum level only for those wave functions on the torus which are periodic if $n$ is even, or antiperiodic if $n$ is odd. If the symplectic form is of rational cohomology class $\frac{n}{r}$, a similar result holds --the wave functions must be either periodic or antiperiodic on a torus $r$ times larger in both direccions, depending on the parity of $nr$. Application of these results to the Abelian Chern-Simons is discussed. '

Nonetheless, we have been able to generalize the multiplet and Lagrangians of this theory to the case of vanishing determinant of the vierbein. Unfortunately, the requirement of regularity does not single out a unique action. '
9707239;'The Running Gravitational Couplings';'Djamel Dou and Roberto Percacci';'Tue, 29 Jul 1997 17:43:54 +0200 (MET_DST)   (21kb)';'   We compute the running of the cosmological constant and Newton's constant taking into account the effect of quantum fields with any spin between 0 and 2. We find that Newton's constant does not vary appreciably but the cosmological constant can change by many orders of magnitude when one goes from cosmological scales to typical elementary particle scales. In the extreme infrared, zero modes drive the cosmological constant to zero. '

Pashnev';'Tue, 29 Jul 1997 19:01:49 +0200   (20kb)';'   We propose a simple method for constructing representations of (super)conformal and nonlinear W-type algebras in terms of their subalgebras and corresponding Nambu-Goldstone fields. We apply it to N=2 and N=1 superconformal algebras and describe in this way various embeddings of strings and superstrings for which these algebras and their subalgebras define world-sheet symmetries. Besides reproducing the known examples, we present some new ones, in particular an embedding of the bosonic string with additional U(1) affine symmetry into N=2 superstring. We also apply our method to the nonlinear $W_3^{(2)}$ algebra and demonstrate that the linearization procedure worked out for it some time ago gets a natural interpretation as a kind of string embedding. All these embeddings include the critical ones as particular cases. '

It includes certain perturbative and non-perturbative (D-instanton) contributions, and it reduces to the correct expressions in different limits. The singularities are poles in the $s$-$t$-$u$ channels, corresponding to the exchange of particles with a mass spectrum coinciding with that of $(p,q)$ string states. We describe the general structure of the associated perturbative corrections to the effective action. '

9707244;'Confinement and Strings in MQCD';'Amihay Hanany, Matthew J. Strassler and Alberto Zaffaroni';'Tue, 29 Jul 1997 19:36:43 MDT   (112kb)';'   We study aspects of confinement in the M theory fivebrane version of QCD (MQCD). We show heavy quarks are confined in hadrons (which take the form of membrane-fivebrane bound states) for N=1 and softly broken N=2 SU(Nc) MQCD. We explore and clarify the transition from the exotic physics of the latter to the standard physics of the former. In particular, the many strings and quark-antiquark mesons found in N=2 field theory by Douglas and Shenker are reproduced. It is seen that in the N=1 limit all but one such meson disappears while all of the strings survive. The strings of softly broken N=2, N=1, and even non-supersymmetric SU(Nc) MQCD have a common ratio for their tensions as a function of the amount of flux they carry. We also comment on the almost BPS properties of the Douglas-Shenker strings and discuss the brane picture for monopole confinement on N=2 QCD Higgs branches. '
9707245;'Fluctuating Strings in the Universal Confining String Theory and';'D.V.Antonov (Humboldt University, Berlin and ITEP, Moscow)';'Wed, 30 Jul 97 13:11:36 METDST   (11kb)';'   The effective string theory emerging from the bilocal approximation to the Method of Vacuum Correlators in gluodynamics is shown to be well described by the 4D theory of the massive Abelian Kalb-Ramond field interacting with the string, which is known to be the low-energy limit of the Universal Confining String Theory. This correspondence follows from the agreement of the behaviour of the coefficient functions, which parametrize the gauge-invariant correlator of two gluonic field strength tensors, known from the lattice data, with their values obtained from the propagator of the Kalb-Ramond field. We discuss this correspondence in several aspects and demonstrate that the mass of the Kalb-Ramond field in this approach plays the role of the inverse correlation length of the vacuum, so that in the massless limit string picture disappears. Next, we apply the background field method, known in the theory of nonlinear sigma models, to obtain the action, which is quadratic in quantum fluctuations around a given (e.g. minimal) string world-sheet. Several nontrivial types of couplings of these fluctuations with the background world-sheet are obtained and discussed. '
9707246;'Open Supermembranes Coupled to M-Theory Five-Branes';'Ph. Brax and J. Mourad';'Wed, 30 Jul 1997 16:31:12 +0100   (10kb)';'   We consider open supermembranes in eleven dimensions in the presence of closed M-Theory five-branes. It has been shown that, in a flat space-time, the world-volume action is kappa invariant and preserves a fraction of the eleven dimensional supersymmetries if the boundaries of the membranes lie on the five-branes. We calculate the reparametrisation anomalies due to the chiral fermions on the boundaries of the membrane and examine their cancellation mechanism. We show that these anomalies cancel with the aid of a classical term in the world-volume action, provided that the tensions of the five-brane and the membrane are related to the eleven dimensional gravitational constant in a way already noticed in M-Theory.

9707247;'Superpotentials of N=1 Supersymmetric Gauge Theories from M-theory';'Soonkeon Nam, Kyungho Oh, Sang-Jin Sin';'Wed, 30 Jul 1997 23:24:05 +0900   (12kb)';'   We consider brane configurations in M-theory describing N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories and using the parametric representation of the brane configurations, we calculate the superpotentials for various cases including multiple gauge groups or fermions. For SU(n) N=1 SQCD with $N_f$ fermion case ($N_f < N_c)$, we find that the superpotential from M-theory and the gauge theory agree precisely. This gives a direct evidence of the validity of Witten's M-theory method for calculating the super potential. '
9707248;'Nambu-Jona-Lasinio Model Coupled to Constant Electromagnetic Fields in';'M. Ishi-i, T. Kashiwa, and N. Tanimura (Kyushu Univ. Fukuoka, Japan)';'Thu, 31 Jul 1997 03:00:12 +0900   (647kb)';'   Critical dynamics of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, coupled to a constant electromagnetic field in D=2, 3, and 4, is reconsidered from a viewpoint of infrared behavior and vacuum instability. The latter is associated with constant electric fields and cannot be avoidable in the nonperturbative framework obtained through the proper time method. As for magnetic fields, an infrared cut-off is essential to investigate the critical phenomena. The result reconfirms the fact that the critical coupling in D=3 and 4 goes to zero even under an infinitesimal magnetic field. There also shows that a non-vanishing $F_{\mu\nu}\widetilde F^{\mu\nu}$ causes instability. A perturbation with respect to external fields is adopted to investigate critical quantities, but the resultant asymptotic expansion excellently matches with the exact value. '

9707250;'M&m's';'Andrei Losev, Gregory Moore and Samson L. Shatashvili';'Wed, 30 Jul 1997 17:10:33 +0500   (28kb)';'   We consider M theory 5-branes with compact transverse dimensions. In certain limits the theory on the 5-brane decouples and defines ``little string theories'' in 5+1 dimensions. We show that the familiar structure of IIA/IIB,M,F- theory in 10,11,12 dimensions respectively has a perfect parallel in a theory of strings and membranes in 6,7,8 dimensions. We call these theories $a/b,m,f$ theories. They have a coupling constant but no gravity. This construction clarifies some mysteries in F-theory and leads to several speculations about the phase structure of M theory. '
9707251;'Four-dimensional BPS-spectra via M-theory';'Mans Henningson and Piljin Yi';'Wed, 30 Jul 97 23:20:32 +0100   (41kb)';'   We consider the realization of four-dimensional theories with N = 2 supersymmetry as M-theory configurations including a five-brane. Our emphasis is on the spectrum of massive states, that are realized as two-branes ending on the five-brane. We start with a determination of the supersymmetries that are left unbroken by the background metric and five-brane. We then show how the central charge of the N = 2 algebra arises from the central charge associated with the M-theory two-brane. This determines the condition for a two-brane configuration to be BPS-saturated in the four-dimensional sense. By imposing certain conditions on the moduli, we can give concrete examples of such two-branes. This leads us to conjecture that vectormultiplet and hypermultiplet BPS-saturated states correspond to two-branes with the topology of a cylinder and a disc respectively. We also discuss the phenomenon of marginal stability of BPS-saturated states. '

This system is described by inhomogeneous Landau-Lifshitz system with an extra non-local term. The Hamiltonian is Bogomol'nyi bounded from below and has four adjusting parameters. The Bogomol'nyi equation is described in detail in analogy with the Newtonian equation of motion and its numerical solution is presented. '

Nesterenko (Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Russia) and I.';'Thu, 31 Jul 1997 18:52:19 +0400   (11kb)';'   A simple method for calculating the Casimir energy for a sphere is developed which is based on a direct mode summation and counter integration in a complex plane of eigenfrequencies. The method uses only classical equations determining the eigenfrequencies of the quantum field under consideration. Efficiency of this approach is demonstrated by calculation of the Casimir energy for a perfectly conducting spherical shell and for a massless scalar field obeying the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on sphere. The possibility of rationalizing the removal of divergences in this problem as a renormalization of both the energy and the radius of the sphere is discussed. '

The spectral problem for these models admits exact solutions for infinitely many eigenstates but not for the whole spectrum. The hermiticity of their hamiltonians is guaranteed by construction. The proposed models have quasi-exactly solvable classical conterparts. '
9707255;'Burgers turbulence with pressure';'S. Boldyrev';'Thu, 31 Jul 1997 18:23:19 -0400 (EDT)   (11kb)';'   The randomly driven Burgers equation with pressure is considered as a 1D model of strong turbulence of compressible fluid. It is shown that infinitely small pressure provides a finite effect on the velocity and density statistics and this case therefore is qualitatively different from turbulence without pressure. We establish the corresponding operator product expansion and predict the intermittent velocity- difference and mass-difference PDFs. We then apply the developed methods to the statistics of a passive scalar advected by the Burgers field. '

We consider the O(N) superconformal algebras up to N=4, as well as the `small N=4' superalgebra. This is done using a superfield formalism, allowing to recover previous results that were expressed in components. Moreover, we identify the `small N=4' algebra as the constrained `large N=4' via a self-duality like condition in superspace. '
9707257;'Multidimensional extension of the generalized Chowla-Selberg formula';'E. Elizalde';'Thu, 31 Jul 1997 12:09:32 +0200   (14kb)';'   After recalling the precise existence conditions of the zeta function of a pseudodifferential operator, and the concept of reflection formula, an exponentially convergent expression for the analytic continuation of a multidimensional inhomogeneous Epstein-type zeta function of the general form \zeta_{A,\vec{b},q} (s) = \sum_{\vec{n}\in Z^p (\vec{n}^T A \vec{n} +\vec{b}^T \vec{n}+q)^{-s}, with $A$ the $p\times p$ matrix of a quadratic form, $\vec{b}$ a $p$ vector and $q$ a constant, is obtained. It is valid on the whole complex $s$-plane, is exponentially convergent and provides the residua at the poles explicitly. It reduces to the famous formula of Chowla and Selberg in the particular case $p=2$, $\vec{b}= \vec{0}$, $q=0$. Some variations of the formula and physical applications are considered. '

With a differential geometrical proof of the s-rule besides an investigation on the global symmetry of M theory brane configurations, an exact description of the baryonic and non-baryonic branches in terms of M theory is presented. The baryonic branch root is also studied. The ``electric'' and ``magnetic'' descriptions of the root are shown to be related with each other by the brane exchange in M theory. '

9707260;'Lattice Tests of Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory?';'Nick Evans (Boston University), Steve Hsu (Yale), Myck Schwetz (Yale)';'Thu, 31 Jul 1997 14:14:35 -0400   (16kb)';'   Supersymmetric Yang Mills theory is directly accessible to lattice simulations using current methodology, and can provide a non-trivial check of recent exact results in SQCD. In order to tune the lattice simulation to the supersymmetric point it is neccessary to understand the behavior of the theory with a small supersymmetry breaking gaugino mass. We introduce a soft breaking gaugino mass in a controlled fashion using a spurion analysis. We compute the gluino condensate, vacuum energy and bound-state masses as a function of the gaugino mass, providing more readily accessible predictions which still test the supersymmetric results. Finally we discuss diagnostics for obtaining the bare lattice parameters that correspond to the supersymmetric continuum limit. '

Plefka';'Thu, 31 Jul 1997 20:40:50 +0200 (MET DST)   (12kb)';'   The supersymmetry algebra for supermembranes, quantized in the light-cone gauge, exhibits central charges induced by wrapping the membrane around compact dimensions. These central charges are manifestly consistent with Lorentz symmetry. While the central charges raise the mass of the membrane states, they still leave the mass spectrum continuous, at least generically. The lower bound on the mass spectrum is set by the winding number and corresponds to a BPS state. '

The symplectic reparametrizations of the special K\"ahler space associated with the vector multiplets induce corresponding transformations on the hypermultiplets. We construct the Sp(1)$\times$Sp($n$) one-forms in terms of which the hypermultiplet couplings are encoded and exhibit their behaviour under symplectic reparametrizations. Both vector and hypermultiplet theories allow vectorial central charges in the supersymmetry algebra associated with integrals over the K\"ahler and hyper-K\"ahler forms, respectively. We show how these charges and the holomorphic BPS mass are related by the mirror map. '

We show here how it works for the GS superstring, BST supermembrane and M-5-brane. We show that the non-linear generalization of the (2,0) d=6 tensor supermultiplet action is the M-5-brane action in a Killing gauge. For D-p-branes the novel feature of quantization is that they can be quantized Lorentz covariantly, in particular, for D-0-brane a gauge exists where the action is covariant and free. We present a general condition on possible choice of gauges for the kappa-symmetric branes. '
9709203;'Reducible Connections in Massless Topological QCD and 4-manifolds';'A.Sako';'Mon, 29 Sep 1997 12:14:31 GMT   (21kb)';'   A role of reducible connections in Non-Abelian Seiberg-Witten invariants is analyzed with massless Topological QCD where monopole is extended to non-Abelian groups version. By giving small external fields, we found that vacuum expectation value can be separated into a part from Donaldson theory, a part from Abelian Monopole theory and a part from non-Abelian monopole theory. As a by-product, we find identities of U(1) topological invariants. In our proof, the duality relation and Higgs mechanism are not necessary. '

Korepin (State University of New York, Stony Brook, USA) and N.';'Mon, 29 Sep 1997 09:25:17 GMT   (10kb)';'   We study models of quantum statistical mechanics which can be solved by the algebraic Bethe ansatz. The general method of calculation of correlation functions is based on the method of determinant representations. The auxiliary Fock space and auxiliary Bose fields are introduced in order to remove the two body scattering and represent correlation functions as a mean value of a determinant of a Fredholm integral operator; the representation has a simple form for large space and time separations. In this paper we explain how to calculate the mean value in the auxiliary Fock space of asymptotic expression of the Fredholm determinant. It is necessary for the evaluation of the asymptotic form of the physical correlation functions. '
9709205;'Aspects of classical and quantum motion on a flux cone';'E. S. Moreira, Jnr';'Mon, 29 Sep 1997 09:48:40 GMT   (67kb)';'   Motion of a non-relativistic particle on a cone with a magnetic flux running through the cone axis (a ``flux cone'') is studied. It is expressed as the motion of a particle moving on the Euclidean plane under the action of a velocity-dependent force. Probability fluid (``quantum flow'') associated with a particular stationary state is studied close to the singularity, demonstrating non trivial Aharonov-Bohm effects. For example, it is shown that near the singularity quantum flow departs from classical flow. In the context of the hydrodynamical approach to quantum mechanics, quantum potential due to the conical singularity is determined and the way it affects quantum flow is analysed. It is shown that the winding number of classical orbits plays a role in the description of the quantum flow. Connectivity of the configuration space is also discussed. '
9709206;'D-brane decay and Hawking Radiation';'Sumit R.

We show that a large class of one (open string) loop corrections to emission processes from D-branes vanish at low energies and nonvanishing loop contributions have an energy dependence consistent with black hole answers, thus providing a justification for the agreement of the tree level results with semiclassical answers.

It has a form of reduced non-autonomous hamiltonian systems which include as particular examples the Schlesinger equations, Painlev\'{e} VI equation and their generalizations. In general case, they are defined as hierarchies of isomonodromic deformations (HID) with respect to changing the moduli of underling curves. HID are accompanying with the Whitham hierarchies. The phase space of HID is the space of flat connections of $G$ bundles with some additional data in the marked points. HID can be derived from some free field theory by the hamiltonian reduction under the action of the gauge symmetries and subsequent factorization with respect to diffeomorphisms of curve. This approach allows to define the Lax equations associated with HID and the linear system whose isomonodromic deformations are provided by HID. In addition, it leads to description of solutions of HID by the projection method.   In some special limit HID convert into the Hitchin systems. In particular, for $\SL$ bundles over elliptic curves with a marked point we obtain in this limit the elliptic Calogero $N$-body system '
9709209;'Closing the Generation Gap';'Eva Silverstein';'Mon, 29 Sep 1997 16:47:24 GMT   (9kb)';'   I describe recent examples of phase transitions in four-dimensional M theory vacua in which the net generation number changes. There are naive obstructions to transitions lifting chiral matter, but loopholes exist which enable us to avoid them. I first review how chirality arises in the heterotic limit of M theory, previously known forms of topology change in string theory, and chirality-changing phase transitions in six dimensions. This leads to the construction of the four-dimensional examples, which involve wrapped M-theory fivebranes at an $E_8$ wall. '

9709213;'Euclidean and Canonical Formulations of Statistical Mechanics in the';'Dmitri Fursaev';'Mon, 29 Sep 1997 21:04:00 GMT   (21kb)';'   The relation between the covariant Euclidean free-energy $F^E$ and the canonical statistical-mechanical free energy $F^C$ in the presence of the Killing horizons is studied. $F^E$ is determined by the covariant Euclidean effective action. The definition of $F^C$ is related to the Hamiltonian which is the generator of the evolution along the Killing time. At arbitrary temperatures $F^E$ acquires additional ultraviolet divergences because of conical singularities. The divergences of $F^C$ are different and occur since the density ${dn \over d\omega}$ of the energy levels of the system blows up near the horizon in an infrared way. We show that there are regularizations that make it possible to remove the infrared cutoff in ${dn \over d\omega}$. After that the divergences of $F^C$ become identical to the divergences of $F^E$. The latter property turns out to be crucial to reconcile the covariant Euclidean and the canonical formulations of the theory. The method we use is new and is based on a relation between ${dn \over d\omega}$ and heat kernels on hyperbolic-like spaces. Our analysis includes spin 0 and spin 1/2 fields on arbitrary backgrounds. For these fields the divergences of ${dn \over d\omega}$, $F^C$ and $F^E$ are presented in the most complete form. '

It is shown that the 11-dimensional membrane is a BPS solution of this theory if stretched between the Z_2 hyperplanes. A similar statement holds for the 11-dimensional 5--brane oriented parallel to the hyperplanes. The parallel membrane and the orthogonal 5-brane, though solutions, break all supersymmetries. Furthermore, we construct the analog of the gauge 5-brane with gauge instantons on the hyperplanes. This solution varies nontrivially along the orbifold direction due to the gauge anomalies located on the orbifold hyperplanes. Its zero mode part is identical to the weakly coupled 10-dimensional gauge 5-brane. '

It is argued that both the string background and the B-V delta operator should be associated with the vertex $\B^0_{0,1}$ corresponding to the once-punctured sphere. This leads naturally to the proposal that the manifestly background independent formulation of quantum closed string field theory is given by the sum $\B$ of the completed set of string vertices satisfying the classical master equation $\{\B,\B\}=0$.

Delbourgo';'Tue, 30 Sep 1997 07:51:52 GMT   (40kb)';'   A direct link between a one-loop N-point Feynman diagram and a geometrical representation based on the N-dimensional simplex is established by relating the Feynman parametric representations to the integrals over contents of (N-1)-dimensional simplices in non-Euclidean geometry of constant curvature. In particular, the four-point function in four dimensions is proportional to the volume of a three-dimensional spherical (or hyperbolic) tetrahedron which can be calculated by splitting into birectangular ones. It is also shown that the known formula of reduction of the N-point function in (N-1) dimensions corresponds to splitting the related N-dimensional simplex into N rectangular ones. '

9709218;'Duality in Landau-Zener-Stueckelberg potential curve crossing';'Kazuo Fujikawa (Univ. of Tokyo) and Hiroshi Suzuki (Ibaraki Univ.)';'Tue, 30 Sep 1997 09:06:27 GMT   (17kb)';'   It is pointed out that there exists an interesting strong and weak duality in the Landau-Zener-Stueckelberg potential curve crossing. A reliable perturbation theory can thus be formulated in the both limits of weak and strong interactions. It is shown that main characteristics of the potential crossing phenomena such as the Landau-Zener formula including its numerical coefficient are well-described by simple (time-independent) perturbation theory without referring to Stokes phenomena. A kink-like topological object appears in the ``magnetic'' picture, which is responsible for the absence of the coupling constant in the prefactor of the Landau-Zener formula. It is also shown that quantum coherence in a double well potential is generally suppressed by the effect of potential curve crossing, which is analogous to the effect of Ohmic dissipation on quantum coherence.

9709219;'Anomaly Inflow on Orientifold Planes';'Keshav Dasgupta and Sunil Mukhi';'Tue, 30 Sep 1997 09:22:29 GMT   (12kb)';'   We examine some six-dimensional orientifold models with $N = 1$ supersymmetry, which can be realised as intersecting 7-branes and 7-planes. These models are studied in the light of recent work showing that orientifold planes carry anomalous gravitational couplings on their world-volume. We show that gravitational anomalies can be locally cancelled by these new couplings at every point in the internal space, under the assumption that the anomaly residing on orientifold planes is distributed in a particular way among brane-plane and plane-plane intersections.

9709220;'D0 Branes on T^n and Matrix Theory';'Ashoke Sen';'Tue, 30 Sep 1997 12:57:34 GMT   (8kb)';'   The Hamiltonian describing Matrix theory on T^n is identified with the Hamiltonian describing the dynamics of D0-branes on T^n in an appropriate weak coupling limit for all n up to 5. New subtleties arise in taking this weak coupling limit for n=6, since the transverse size of the D0 brane system blows up in this limit. This can be attributed to the appearance of extra light states in the theory from wrapped D6 branes. This subtlety is related to the difficulty in finding a Matrix formulation of M-theory on T^6. '
9709221;'A Skyrme lattice with hexagonal symmetry';'Richard Battye and Paul Sutcliffe';'Tue, 30 Sep 1997 10:32:32 GMT   (65kb)';'   Recently it has been found that the structure of Skyrmions has a close analogy to that of fullerene shells in carbon chemistry. In this letter we show that this analogy continues further, by presenting a Skyrme field that describes a lattice of Skyrmions with hexagonal symmetry. This configuration, a novel `domain wall' in the Skyrme model, has low energy per baryon (about 6% above the Faddeev-Bogomolny bound) and in many ways is analogous to graphite. By comparison to the energy per baryon of other known Skyrmions and also the Skyrme crystal, we discuss the possibility of finding Skyrmion shells of higher charge. '
9709222;'N=1 Dual String Pairs and their Modular Superpotentials';'Dieter Lust';'Tue, 30 Sep 1997 11:44:38 GMT   (18kb)';'   We review the duality between heterotic and F--theory string vacua with N=1 space-time supersymmetry in eight, six and four dimensions. In particular, we discuss two chains of four-dimensional F--theory/heterotic dual string pairs, where F--theory is compactified on certain elliptic Calabi-Yau fourfolds, and the dual heterotic vacua are given by compactifications on elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds plus the specification of the $E_8\times E_8$ gauge bundles. We show that the massless spectra of the dual pairs agree by using, for one chain of models, an index formula to count the heterotic bundle moduli and determine the dual F--theory spectra from the Hodge numbers of the fourfolds and of the type IIB base spaces. Moreover as a further check, we demonstrate that for one particular heterotic/F--theory dual pair the N=1 superpotentials are the same. '
9709223;'Non-Equilibrium Quantum Electrodynamics';'C. Anastopoulos and A.

The reduced density matrix propagator for the spinor field is then constructed. We discuss the role of time-dependent renormalization in the propagator and focus on the possibility of obtaining dynamically induced superselection rules. Finally, we derive the master equation for the case of the field being in an one-particle state in a non-relativistic regime and discuss whether EM vacuumm fluctuations are sufficient to produce decoherence in the position basis.

9709224;'(Anti-)Evaporation of Schwarzschild-de Sitter Black Holes';'Raphael Bousso and Stephen Hawking (DAMTP, Cambridge)';'Tue, 30 Sep 1997 21:14:18 GMT   (12kb)';'   We study the quantum evolution of black holes immersed in a de Sitter background space. For black holes whose size is comparable to that of the cosmological horizon, this process differs significantly from the evaporation of asymptotically flat black holes. Our model includes the one-loop effective action in the s-wave and large N approximation. Black holes of the maximal mass are in equilibrium. Unexpectedly, we find that nearly maximal quantum Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes anti-evaporate. However, there is a different perturbative mode that leads to evaporation. We show that this mode will always be excited when a pair of cosmological holes nucleates. '
9709225;'Six Dimensional Schwarzschild Black Holes in M(atrix) Theory';'Edi Halyo';'Tue, 30 Sep 1997 22:29:19 GMT   (5kb)';'   We calculate the entropy of six dimensional Schwarzschild black holes in matrix theory. We use the description of the matrix model on $T^5$ as the world-volume theory of NS five-branes and show that the black hole entropy is reproduced by noncritical closed strings with fractional tension living on the five-brane.

9709227;'New Canonical Variables for d=11 Supergravity';'Stephan Melosch and Hermann Nicolai';'Tue, 30 Sep 1997 14:47:46 GMT   (14kb)';'   A set of new canonical variables for $d=11$ supergravity is proposed which renders the supersymmetry variations and the supersymmetry constraint polynomial. The construction is based on the $SO(1,2)\times SO(16)$ invariant reformulation of $d=11$ supergravity given in previous work, and has some similarities with Ashtekar's reformulation of Einstein's theory. The new bosonic variables fuse the gravitational degrees of freedom with those of the three-index photon $A_{MNP}$ in accordance with the hidden symmetries of the dimensionally reduced theory. Although $E_8$ is not a symmetry of the theory, the bosonic sector exhibits a remarkable $E_8$ structure, hinting at the existence of a novel type of ``exceptional geometry''. '
9709228;'Two Dimensional Mirror Symmetry From M-theory';'John Brodie (Princeton University)';'Tue, 30 Sep 1997 23:36:35 GMT   (20kb)';'   We construct two dimensional gauge theories with $N= (4,4)$ supersymmetry from branes of type IIA string theory. Quantum effects in the two dimensional gauge theory are analyzed by embedding the IIA brane construction into M-theory. We find that the Coulomb branch of one theory and the Higgs branch of a mirror theory become equivalent at strong coupling. A relationship to the decoupling limit of the type IIA and IIB 5-branes in Matrix theory is shown. T-duality between the ALE metric and the wormhole metric of Callan, Harvey, and Strominger is discussed from a brane perspective and some puzzles regarding string duality resolved. We comment on the existence of a quantum Higgs branch in two dimensional theories. Branes prove to be useful tools in analyzing singular conformal field theories. '
9709229;'Canonical Structure of Classical Field Theory in the Polymomentum Phase';'I.V. Kanatchikov';'Tue, 30 Sep 1997 23:52:15 GMT   (51kb)';'   Canonical structure of the space-time symmetric analogue of the Hamiltonian formalism in field theory based on the De Donder-Weyl (DW) theory is studied. In $n$ space-time dimensions the set of $n$ polymomenta is associated to the space-time derivatives of field variables. The polysymplectic $(n+1)$-form generalizes the simplectic form and gives rise to a map between horizontal forms playing the role of dynamical variables and vertical multivectors generalizing Hamiltonian vector fields. Graded Poisson bracket is defined on forms and leads to the structure of a Z-graded Lie algebra on the subspace of the so-called Hamiltonian forms for which the map above exists. A generalized Poisson structure arises in the form of what we call a ``higher-order'' and a right Gerstenhaber algebra. Field euations and the equations of motion of forms are formulated in terms of the graded Poisson bracket with the DW Hamiltonian $n$-form $H\vol$ ($\vol$ is the space-time volume form and $H$ is the DW Hamiltonian function). A few applications to scalar fields, electrodynamics and the Nambu-Goto string, and a relation to the standard Hamiltonian formalism in field theory are briefly discussed. This is a detailed and improved account of our earlier concise communications (hep-th/9312162, hep-th/9410238, and hep-th/9511039). '

9710202;'Finite quantum field theories: Clifford algebras for Yukawa couplings?';'Wolfgang Lucha, Michael Moser';'Mon, 27 Oct 1997 12:44:44 GMT   (14kb)';'   By imposing on the most general renormalizable quantum field theory the requirement of the absence of ultraviolet-divergent renormalizations of the physical parameters (masses and coupling constants) of the theory, finite quantum field theories in four space-time dimensions may be constructed. Famous prototypes of these form certain well-known classes of supersymmetric finite quantum field theories. Within a perturbative evaluation of the quantum field theories under consideration, the starting point of all such investigations is represented by the conditions for one- and two-loop finiteness of the gauge couplings as well as for one-loop finiteness of the Yukawa couplings. Particularly attractive solutions of the one-loop Yukawa finiteness condition involve Yukawa couplings which are equivalent to generators of Clifford algebras with identity element. However, a closer inspection shows, at least for all simple gauge groups up to and including rank 8, that these Clifford-like solutions prove to be inconsistent with the requirements of one- and two-loop finiteness of the gauge coupling and of absence of gauge anomalies.

Chitov';'Mon, 27 Oct 1997 13:48:56 GMT   (30kb)';'   An investigation of the Nambu-Jona-Lasino model with external constant electric and weak gravitational fields is carried out in three- and four- dimensional spacetimes. The effective potential of the composite bifermionic fields is calculated keeping terms linear in the curvature, while the electric field effect is treated exactly by means of the proper- time formalism.   A rich dynamical symmetry breaking pattern, accompanied by phase transitions which are ruled, independently, by both the curvature and the electric field strength is found. Numerical simulations of the transitions are presented. '
9710204;'Mechanism for long Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde strings';'Vipul Periwal and Oyvind Tafjord';'Mon, 27 Oct 1997 16:04:50 GMT   (3kb)';'   The proposal of Dijkgraaf, Verlinde and Verlinde for the emergence of smooth strings from a supersymmetric U(N) Yang-Mills theory assumes that conjugacy classes in the symmetric group with a few long cycles dominate the dynamics about the infrared fixed point. It is shown that the average number of cycles in a conjugacy class of $S_{N}$ is bounded below by $const.\sqrt N\ln\sqrt N,$ implying that some physical mechanism is needed to ensure the assumed dominance. It is shown that if individual cycles have positive energies that depend very weakly on their lengths, then long cycles dominate the dynamics at low temperatures. '

The main topics are: the abelian projection on the lattice and in the continuum, a numerical study of the abelian monopoles in the lattice gauge theory. Additionally, we briefly review the notation of differential forms, duality, and the BKT transformation in the lattice gauge theories. '
9710206;'Anomalies, Branes, and Currents';'Yeuk-Kwan E. Cheung and Zheng Yin';'Tue, 28 Oct 1997 00:52:24 GMT   (25kb)';'   When a D-brane wraps around a cycle of a curved manifold, the twisting of its normal bundle can induce chiral asymmetry in its worldvolume theory. We obtain the general form of the resulting anomalies for D-branes and their intersections. They are not cancelled among themselves, and the standard inflow mechanism does not apply at first sight because of their apparent lack of factorizability and the apparent vanishing of the corresponding inflow. We show however after taking into consideration the effects of the nontrivial topology of the normal bundles, the anomalies can be transformed into factorized forms and precisely cancelled by finite inflow from the Chern-Simons actions for the D-branes as long as the latter are well defined. We then consider examples in type II compactifications where the twisting of the normal bundles occurs and calculate the changes in the induced Ramond-Ramond charges on the D-branes. '
9710207;'Block-Orthogonal Brane Systems, Black Holes and Wormholes';'K.A. Bronnikov';'Mon, 27 Oct 1997 22:49:40 GMT   (16kb)';'   Multidimensional cosmological, static spherically symmetric and Euclidean configurations are described in a unified way for gravity interacting with several dilatonic fields and antisymmetric forms, associated with electric and magnetic p-branes. Exact solutions are obtained when certain vectors, built from the input parameters of the model, are either orthogonal in the minisuperspace, or form mutually orthogonal subsystems. Some properties of black-hole solutions are indicated, in particular, a no-hair-type theorem and restrictions emerging in models with multiple times. From the non-existence of Lorentzian wormholes, a universal restriction is obtained, applicable to orthogonal or block-orthogonal subsystems of any p-brane systems. Euclidean wormhole solutions are found, their actions and radii are explicitly calculated. '

Ovrut and Daniel Waldram';'Tue, 28 Oct 1997 03:34:33 GMT   (37kb)';'   The low-energy D=4, N=1 effective action of the strongly coupled heterotic string is explicitly computed by compactifying Horava-Witten theory on the deformed Calabi-Yau three-fold solution due to Witten. It is shown that, to order kappa^{2/3}, the Kahler potential is identical to that of the weakly coupled theory. Furthermore, the gauge kinetic functions are directly computed to order kappa^{4/3} and shown to receive a non-vanishing correction. Also, we compute gauge matter terms in the Kahler potential to the order kappa^{4/3} and find a nontrivial correction to the dilaton term. Part of those corrections arise from background fields that depend on the orbifold coordinate and are excited by four-dimensional gauge field source terms. '

For instance, the gauge potential induced on $S^2$ is that of a magnetic monopole located at the center of $S^2$. We find that the gauge potential induced on $S^3$ ($S^{2n+1}$) is that of a meron (generalized meron) also sitting at the center of $S^3$ ($S^{2n+1}$). '
9710210;'Yangian Symmetry in Integrable Quantum Gravity';'D. Korotkin and H.

The transition matrices of the associated linear system provide a complete set of conserved charges. Their Poisson algebra is a semi-classical Yangian double modified by a twist which is a remnant of the underlying coset structure. The classical Geroch group is generated by the Lie-Poisson action of these charges. Canonical quantization of the structure leads to a twisted Yangian double with fixed central extension at a critical level. '
9710211;'Hamiltonian analysis of gauged CP^1 model, with or without Hopf term,';'B. Chakraborty (S. N. Bose Natl. Centr.)';'Tue, 28 Oct 1997 10:32:53 GMT   (12kb)';'   Recently it has been shown by Cho and Kimm that the gauged $CP^1$ model, obtained by gauging the global SU(2) group of $CP^1$ model and adding a corresponding Chern-Simons term, has got its own soliton. These solitons are somewhat distinct from those of pure $CP^1$ model, as they cannot always be characterised by $\pi_2(CP^1)=Z$. In this paper, we first carry out the Hamiltonian analysis of this gauged $CP^1$ model. Then we couple the Hopf term, associated to these solitons and again carry out its Hamiltonian analysis. The symplectic structures, along with the structures of the constraints, of these two models (with or without Hopf term) are found to be essentially the same. The model with Hopf term, is then shown to have fractional spin, which however depends not only on the soliton number $N$ but also on the nonabelian charge. '

9710213;'On the Z_2 Monopole of Spin(10) Gauge Theories';'Wang-Chang Su';'Tue, 28 Oct 1997 12:41:08 GMT   (14kb)';'   An "expanded" description is introduced to examine the spinor-monopole identification proposed by Strassler for four-dimensional $\cal N$ = 1 supersymmetric Spin(10) gauge theories with matter in F vector and N spinor representations. It is shown that a Z_2 monopole in the "expanded" theory is associated with massive spinors of the Spin(10) theory. For N=2, two spinor case, we confirm this identification by matching the transformation properties of the two theories under SU(2) flavor symmetry. However, for N $\ge$ 3, the transformation properties are not matched between the spinors and the monopole. This disagreement might be due to the fact that the SU(N) flavor symmetry of the Spin(10) theory is partially realized as an SU(2) symmetry in the "expanded" theory. '
9710214;'Supersymmetric Electrovacs In Gauged Supergravities';'P. M. Cowdall (Cambridge University)';'Tue, 28 Oct 1997 13:01:50 GMT   (15kb)';'   We show that the D=6 SU(2) gauged supergravity of van Nieuwenhuizen et al, obtained by dimensional reduction of the D=7 topologically massive gauged supergravity and previously thought not to be dimensionally reducible, can be further reduced to five and four dimensions. On reduction to D=4 one recovers the special case of the SU(2)XSU(2) gauged supergravity of Freedman and Schwarz for which one of the SU(2) coupling constants vanishes. Previously known supersymmetric electrovacs of this model then imply new ground states in 7-D. We construct a supersymmetric electrovac solution of N=2 SU(2) gauged supergravity in 7-D. We also investigate the domain wall solutions of these theories and show they preserve a half of the supersymmetry. '

We argue that the continuity of the spectrum persists irrespective of the presence of winding around compact target-space directions and discuss the central charges in the superalgebra arising from winding membrane configurations. Along the way we comment on the structure of open supermembranes. '
9710216;'Discrete Classical Electromagnetic Fields';'Manoelito M. de Souza';'Tue, 28 Oct 1997 17:25:05 GMT   (16kb)';'   The classical electromagnetic field of a spinless point electron is described in a formalism with extended causality by discrete finite transverse point-vector fields with discrete and localized point interactions. These fields are taken as a classical representation of photons, ``classical photons". They are all transversal photons; there are no scalar nor longitudinal photons as these are definitely eliminated by the gauge condition. The angular distribution of emitted photons coincides with the directions of maximum emission in the standard formalism. The Maxwell formalism and its standard field are retrieved by the replacement of these discrete fields by their space-time averages, and in this process scalar and longitudinal photons are necessarily created and added. Divergences and singularities are by-products of this averaging process. This formalism enlighten the meaning and the origin of the non-physical photons, the ones that violate the Lorentz condition in manifestly covariant quantization methods. '
9710217;'Comments on Black Holes in Matrix Theory';'Gary T. Horowitz and Emil J. Martinec';'Wed, 29 Oct 1997 00:09:32 GMT   (14kb)';'   The recent suggestion that the entropy of Schwarzschild black holes can be computed in matrix theory using near-extremal D-brane thermodynamics is examined. It is found that the regime in which this approach is valid actually describes black strings stretched across the longitudinal direction, near the transition where black strings become unstable to the formation of black holes. It is argued that the appropriate dynamics on the other (black hole) side of the transition is that of the zero modes of the corresponding super Yang-Mills theory. A suggestive mean field theory argument is given for the entropy of black holes in all dimensions. Consequences of the analysis for matrix theory and the holographic principle are discussed. '
9710218;'Creation of Fundamental String in M(atrix) Theory';'Nobuyoshi Ohta, Takashi Shimizu and Jian-Ge Zhou';'Wed, 29 Oct 1997 02:53:31 GMT   (10kb)';'   The potential between two D4-branes at angles with partially unbroken supersymmetry is computed, and is used to discuss the creation of a fundamental string when two such D4-branes cross each other in M(atrix) theory. The effective Lagrangian is shown to be anomalous at 1-loop approximation, but it can be modified by bare Chern-Simons terms to preserve the invariance under the large gauge transformation. The resulting effective potential agrees with that obtained from the string calculations. The result shows that a fundamental string is created in order to cancel the repulsive force between two D4-branes at proper angles. '

Its concepts are inspired by Feynman's atomistic idea about the physical world and by the extension of fluid dynamics to shorter distances through the Boltzmann transport equation. The extending tt Lagrangians imply the original Lagrangians as path-integralwise approximations. By constructing a tt Lagrangian that extends a general gauge-invariant Lagrangian, we show that a tt extension of the standard model is feasible. We define a tt Lagrangian in terms of tt fields of the spacetime variable and an additional, four-vector variable. We explain the fields of quantum field theories as certain covariant, local averages of tt fields. Only two tt fields may be needed for modeling fundamental interactions: (i) a four-vector one unifying all fundamental forces, and (ii) a two-component-spinor one unifying all fundamental matter particles. We comment on the new physics expected within the tt framework put forward, and point out some open questions. '
9710221;'The Non-abelian Chern-Simons Coefficient in the Higgs Phase';'Hsien-chung Kao';'Wed, 29 Oct 1997 07:57:11 GMT   (9kb)';'   We calculate the one loop corrections to the Chern-Simons coefficient $\kappa$ in the Higgs phase of Yang-Mills Chern-Simons Higgs theories. When the gauge group is SU(N), we show, by taking into account the effect of the would be Chern-Simons term, that the corrections are always integer multiples of ${1\over 4\pi}$, as they should for the theories to be quantum-mechanically consistent. In particular, the correction is vanishing for SU(2). The same method can also be applied to the case that the gauge group is SO(N). The result for SO(2) agrees with that found in the abelian Chern-Simons theories. Therefore, the calculation provides with us a unified understanding of the quantum correction to the Chern-Simons coefficient. '

By analyzing the instanton contribution we compute the non-perturbative corrections to the mass spectrum of the theory and the quantum deformation of the classical vacua space. In contrast to known examples the non-perturbative bosonic potential is saturated by the one-instanton contribution and can be directly found within the semiclassical expansion around the one-instanton saddle point.

9710223;'M-Fivebrane from the Open Supermembrane';'C.S. Chu and E. Sezgin';'Wed, 29 Oct 1997 14:25:11 GMT   (10kb)';'   Covariant field equations of M-fivebrane in eleven dimensional curved superspace are obtained from the requirement of kappa-symmetry of an open supermembrane ending on a fivebrane. The worldvolume of the latter is a (6|16) dimensional supermanifold embedded in the (11|32) dimensional target superspace. The kappa-symmetry of the system imposes a constraint on this embedding, and a constraint on a modified super 3-form field strength on the fivebrane worldvolume. These constraints govern the dynamics of the M-fivebrane. '

The method imposes restrictions on the possible gauge fixing conditions and leads to well defined inner product states through a gauge regularisation procedure. Two explicit examples are also treated in detail. '
9710225;'Causal Perturbation Theory and Differential Renormalization';'Dirk Prange';'Wed, 29 Oct 1997 16:32:24 GMT   (20kb)';'   In Causal Perturbation Theory the process of renormalization is precisely equivalent to the extension of time ordered distributions to coincident points. This is achieved by a modified Taylor subtraction on the corresponding test functions. I show that the pullback of this operation to the distributions yields expressions known from Differential Renormalization. The subtraction is equivalent to BPHZ subtraction in momentum space. Some examples from Euclidean scalar field theory in flat and curved spacetime will be presented. '

9710227;'The Schwinger and Thirring models at finite chemical potential and';'Ramon F.Alvarez-Estrada, Angel Gomez Nicola';'Wed, 29 Oct 1997 19:06:05 GMT   (32kb)';'   We study the generating functional for the massless Schwinger model in the torus, at nonzero chemical potential and temperature. The lack of hermiticity of the Dirac operator yields a non-trivial phase in the effective action, which is a topological contribution induced by the chemical potential. In the sector with no zero modes, we evaluate exactly the generating functional, the partition function, the boson propagator and the thermally averaged Polyakov loop. The system bosonizes at finite T and \mu, with the same mass as in vacuum. From the solution obtained for the Schwinger model we derive also exactly the generating functional and the partition function for the massless Thirring model at nonzero T and \mu. '
9710228;'On central charges and the entropy in matrix theory';'Klaus Behrndt';'Wed, 29 Oct 1997 21:44:30 GMT   (10kb)';'   The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of BPS black holes can be obtained as the minimum of the mass (= largest central charge). In this letter we investigate the analog procedure for the matrix model of M-theory. Especially we discuss the configurations: (i) $2 \times 2 \times 2$ corresponding to the 5-d black hole and (ii) the $5 \times 5 \times 5$ configuration yielding the 5-d string. After getting their matrix-entropy, we discuss a way of counting of microstates in matrix theory. As Yang Mills field theory we propose the gauged world volume theory of the 11-d KK monopole. '

9710230;'K-theory and Ramond-Ramond charge';'Ruben Minasian and Gregory Moore';'Thu, 30 Oct 1997 02:18:32 GMT   (10kb)';'   We discuss the relation between the Ramond-Ramond charges of D-branes and the topology of Chan-Paton vector bundles. We show that a topologically nontrivial normal bundle induces RR charge and that the result fits in perfectly with the proposal that D-brane charge is the topology of the Chan-Paton bundle, regarded as an element of K-theory.

The manuscript is intended to be a mini-review of Matrix Theory. The motivations and some of the evidence for the theory are presented, as well as a clear statement of the current puzzles about compactification to low dimensions. '
9710233;'Flow equations for QED in the light front dynamics';'E.L.Gubankova, F.Wegner';'Thu, 30 Oct 1997 11:40:29 GMT   (46kb)';'   The method of flow equations is applied to QED on the light front. Requiring that the partical number conserving terms in the Hamiltonian are considered to be diagonal and the other terms off-diagonal an effective Hamiltonian is obtained which reduces the positronium problem to a two-particle problem, since the particle number violating contributions are eliminated. No infrared divergencies appear. The ultraviolet renormalization can be performed simultaneously. '
9710234;'Modular Localization, H-Temperatures and the Bethe Ansatz Structure';'Bert Schroer (FU-Berlin)';'Thu, 30 Oct 1997 12:26:01 GMT   (31kb)';'   The recently proposed constructive approach to nonperturbative QFT, based on modular localization, is reviewed and extended. It allows to unify black holes physics and H-temperatures (H standing for Hawking or Horizon) with the bootstrap-formfactor program for nonperturbative construction of low dimensional QFT. In case of on-shell particle number conservation, the equations characterizing the modular localization spaces for wedges are Bethe-Ansatz equation in the form as recently obtained in the treatment of factorizable models.

9710235;'Ground State in Gluodynamics and Quark Confinement';'K.Zarembo';'Thu, 30 Oct 1997 14:39:44 GMT   (11kb)';'   The properties of the ground state wavefunctional in gluodynamics responsible for confinement are considered. It is shown that confinement arises due to the generation of a mass gap in the averaging over the gauge group which is necessary to ensure the gauge invariance of the ground state. The string tension is calculated in assumption of a particular infrared behavior of the vacuum wavefunctional. '
9710236;'Modified N=2 supersymmetry and Fayet-Iliopoulos terms';'E.A. Ivanov and B.M. Zupnik';'Thu, 30 Oct 1997 16:24:52 GMT   (21kb)';'   We study peculiarities of realization of N=2 supersymmetry in N=2 abelian gauge theory with two sorts of FI terms, electric and magnetic ones, within manifestly supersymmetric formulations via the Mezincescu and harmonic-analytic prepotentials. We obtain a `magnetic', duality- transformed superfield form of the N=2 Maxwell effective holomorphic action with standard electric $FI$ term and demonstrate that in such a system off-shell N=2 supersymmetry is inevitably realized in an unusual Goldstone mode corresponding to the {\it partial} spontaneous breaking down to N=1. On shell, the standard total breaking occurs. In a system with the two sorts of FI terms, off-shell N=2 supersymmetry is realized in the partial breaking mode both in the electric and magnetic representations. This regime is retained on shell due to the Antoniadis- Partouche-Taylor mechanism. We show that the off-shell algebra of N=2 supersymmetry in the partial breaking realization is modified on gauge-variant objects like potentials and prepotentials. The closure of spinor charges involves some special gauge transformations before any gauge-fixing. '

Petrini';'Thu, 30 Oct 1997 16:59:03 GMT   (31kb)';'   We consider the Compton amplitude for the scattering of a photon and a (massless) ``electron/positron'' at one loop (i.e. genus one) in a four-dimensional fermionic heterotic string model. Starting from the bosonization of the world-sheet fermions needed to explicitly construct the spin-fields representing the space-time fermions, we present all the steps of the computation which leads to the explicit form of the amplitude as an integral of modular forms over the moduli space.

Rossini (MIT)';'Thu, 30 Oct 1997 19:51:05 GMT   (10kb)';'   We compute the Schwinger terms in the energy-momentum tensor commutator algebra from the anomalies present in Weyl-invariant and diffeomorphism-invariant effective actions for two dimensional massless scalar fields in a gravitational background. We find that the Schwinger terms are not sensitive to the regularization procedure and that they are independent of the background metric. '
9710239;'SUSY field theories, integrable systems and their stringy/brane origin';'A.Gorsky, S.Gukov, A.Mironov';'Thu, 30 Oct 1997 20:46:19 GMT   (26kb)';'   Five and six dimensional SUSY gauge theories, with one or two compactified directions, are discussed. The 5d theories with the matter hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation are associated with the twisted $XXZ$ spin chain, while the group product case with the bi-fundamental matter corresponds to the higher rank spin chains. The Riemann surfaces for $6d$ theories with fundamental matter and two compact directions are proposed to correspond to the $XYZ$ spin chain based on the Sklyanin algebra. We also discuss the obtained results within the brane and geometrical engeneering frameworks and explain the relation to the toric diagrams. '
9710240;'The Spectrum of a Large N Gauge Theory Near Transition from Confinement';'David J. Gross, Akikazu Hashimoto, and Igor R. Klebanov';'Fri, 31 Oct 1997 00:01:43 GMT   (29kb)';'   We study the spectrum of 1+1 dimensional large $N$ QCD coupled to an adjoint Majorana fermion of mass $m$. As $m\to 0$ this model makes a transition from confinement to screening. We argue that in this limit the spectrum becomes continuous for mass greater than twice the mass of the lightest bound state. This critical mass is nothing but the threshold for a decay into two lightest states. We present numerical results based on DLCQ that appear to support our claim. '
9710241;'Relative entropy in 2d Quantum Field Theory, finite-size corrections and';'J. Gaite';'Thu, 30 Oct 1997 20:53:39 GMT   (8kb)';'   The relative entropy in two-dimensional Field Theory is studied for its application as an irreversible quantity under the Renormalization Group, relying on a general monotonicity theorem for that quantity previously established. In the cylinder geometry, interpreted as finite-temperature field theory, one can define from the relative entropy a monotonic quantity similar to Zamolodchikov's c function. On the other hand, the one-dimensional quantum thermodynamic entropy also leads to a monotonic quantity, with different properties. The relation of thermodynamic quantities with the complex components of the stress tensor is also established and hence the entropic c theorems are proposed as analogues of Zamolodchikov's c theorem for the cylinder geometry.

9710242;'On the Bound States of Matrix Strings';'Vatche Sahakian';'Thu, 30 Oct 1997 22:18:32 GMT   (12kb)';'   We investigate excitations in Matrix Theory on T^2 corresponding to bound states of strings. We demonstrate the Dirichlet aspect of R-R charged vacua through a non-trivial connection between the U(1) and SU(n) sectors of the matrix SYM. '
9710243;'Fibre Bundles and Generalised Dimensional Reduction';'I.V. Lavrinenko, H. Lu and C.N. Pope';'Fri, 31 Oct 1997 01:25:05 GMT   (22kb)';'   We study some geometrical and topological aspects of the generalised dimensional reduction of supergravities in D=11 and D=10 dimensions, which give rise to massive theories in lower dimensions. In these reductions, a global symmetry is used in order to allow some of the fields to have a non-trivial dependence on the compactifying coordinates. Global consistency in the internal space imposes topological restrictions on the parameters of the compactification as well as the structure of the space itself. Examples that we consider include the generalised reduction of the type IIA and type IIB theories on a circle, and also the massive ten-dimensional theory obtained by the generalised reduction of D=11 supergravity.

9710244;'Dirac Quantisation Conditions and Kaluza-Klein Reduction';'M.S. Bremer, H. Lu, C.N. Pope and K.S. Stelle';'Fri, 31 Oct 1997 21:04:16 GMT   (37kb)';'   We present the form of the Dirac quantisation condition for the p-form charges carried by p-brane solutions of supergravity theories. This condition agrees precisely with the conditions obtained in lower dimensions, as is necessary for consistency with Kaluza-klein dimensional reduction. These considerations also determine the charge lattice of BPS soliton states, which proves to be a universal modulus-independent lattice when the charges are defined to be the canonical charges corresponding to the quantum supergravity symmetry groups.

9710245;'M(atrix) Theory on T9/Z2 Orbifold and Twisted Zero Brane';'N. Kim and Soo-Jong Rey';'Fri, 31 Oct 1997 10:48:24 GMT   (8kb)';'   M(atrix) theory compactified on an orbifold ${\bf T}_9/{\bf Z}_2$ is studied. Via zero-brane parton scattering we find that each of the $2^9 = 512$ orbifold fixed points carry $-1/32$ units of zero-brane charge. The anomalous flux is cancelled by introducing a twisted sector consisting of 32 zero-branes that are spacetime supersymmetry singlets. These twisted sector zero-branes are nothing but gravitational waves propagating along the M-theory direction. There is no D0-partons in the untwisted sector, a fact consistent with holographic principle. For low-energy excitations, the orbifold compactification is described by ten-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group $SO(32)$. '
9710246;'Recent Developments in String Theory';'W. Lerche';'Fri, 31 Oct 1997 13:34:51 GMT   (388kb)';'   After briefly reviewing basic concepts of perturbative string theory, we explain in simple terms some of the new findings that created excitement among the string physicists. These developments include non-perturbative dualities and a unified picture that embraces the so-far known theories. (An overview for non-experts) '
9710247;'Matching the BPS Spectra of Heterotic - Type I - Type I' Strings';'D. Matalliotakis, H. P. Nilles, S. Theisen';'Fri, 31 Oct 1997 16:01:48 GMT   (14kb)';'   We give a detailed discussion of the matching of the BPS states of heterotic, type I and type I' theories in d=9 for general backgrounds. This allows us to explicitly identify these (composite) brane states in the type I' theory that lead to gauge symmetry enhancement at critical points in moduli space. An example is the enhancement of $SO(16)\times SO(16)$ to $E_8\times E_8$. '
9710248;'Isomonodromic Properties of the Seiberg-Witten Solution';'Andrea Cappelli, Paolo Valtancoli and Luca Vergnano';'Fri, 31 Oct 1997 16:06:48 GMT   (52kb)';'   The Seiberg-Witten solution of N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) gauge theories with matter is analysed as an isomonodromy problem. We show that the holomorphic section describing the effective action can be deformed by moving its singularities on the moduli space while keeping their monodromies invariant. Well-known examples of isomonodromic sections are given by the correlators of two-dimensional rational conformal field theories -- the conformal blocks. The Seiberg-Witten section similarly admits the operations of braiding and fusing of its singularities, which obey the Yang-Baxter and Pentagonal identities, respectively. Using them, we easily find the complete expressions of the monodromies with affine term, and the full quantum numbers of the BPS spectrum. While the braiding describes the quark-monopole transmutation, the fusing implies the superconformal points in the moduli space. In the simplest case of three singularities, the supersymmetric sections are directly related to the conformal blocks of the logarithmic minimal models. '
9710249;'String Field Equations From Generalized Sigma Model II';'Korkut Bardakci';'Sat, 1 Nov 1997 00:04:44 GMT   (28kb)';'   We improve and extend a method introduced in an earlier paper for deriving string field equations. The idea is to impose conformal invariance on a generalized sigma model, using a background field method that ensures covariance under very general non-local coordinate transformations. The method is used to derive the free string equations, as well as the interacting equations for the graviton-dilaton system. The full interacting string equations derived by this method should be manifestly background independent. '
9710250;'Feynman Rules in N=2 Projective Superspace I: Massless hypermultiplets';'F. Gonzalez-Rey, U. Lindstrom, M. Rocek, R. von Unge and S. Wiles';'Sat, 1 Nov 1997 00:30:41 GMT   (18kb)';'   Manifestly N=2 supersymmetric Feynman rules are found for different off-shell realizations of the massless hypermultiplet in projective superspace. When we reduce the Feynman rules to an N=1 superspace we obtain the correct component propagators. The Feynman rules are shown to be compatible with a ``duality'' that acts only on the auxiliary fields, as well as with the usual duality relating the hypermultiplet to the tensor multiplet. '
9711201;'A Note on Toroidal Compactifications of the Type I Superstring and Other';'Massimo Bianchi, (Dipartimento di Fisica, Universita` di Roma ``Tor';'Fri, 28 Nov 1997 00:54:53 GMT   (18kb)';'   We show that various disconnected components of the moduli space of superstring vacua with 16 supercharges admit a rationale in terms of BPS un-orientifolds, i.e. type I toroidal compactifications with constant non-vanishing but quantized vacuum expectation values of the NS-NS antisymmetric tensor. These include various heterotic vacua with reduced rank, known as CHL strings, and their dual type II (2,2) superstrings below D=6. Type I vacua without open strings allow for an interpretation of several disconnected components with N_V=10-D. An adiabatic argument relates these unconventional type I superstrings to type II (4,0) superstrings without D-branes. The latter are connected by U-duality below D=6 to type II (2,2) superstrings. We also comment on the relation between some of these vacua and compactifications of the putative M-theory on unorientable manifolds as well as F-theory vacua. '
9711202;'BPS Dynamics of Triple (p,q) String Junction';'Soo-Jong Rey and Jung-Tay Yee';'Fri, 28 Nov 1997 12:03:48 GMT   (14kb)';'   We study dynamics of triple junction of (p,q) strings in Type IIB string theory. We probe tension and mass density of (p,q) strings by studying harmonic fluctuations of the triple junction. We show that they agree perfectly with BPS formula provided suitable geometric interpretation of the junction is given. We provide a precise statement of BPS limit and force-balance property. At weak coupling and sufficiently dense limit, we argue that (p,q)-string embedded in string network is a `wiggly string', whose low-energy dynamics can be described via renormalization group evolved, smooth effective non-relativistic string. We also suggest the possibility that, upon Type IIB strings are promoted to M-theory membrane, there can exist `evanescent' bound-states at triple junction in the continuum. '
9711203;'Superembeddings, Non-Linear Supersymmetry and 5-branes';'Tom Adawi, Martin Cederwall, Ulf Gran, Magnus Holm and Bengt E.W.';'Fri, 28 Nov 1997 13:44:50 GMT   (25kb)';'   We examine general properties of superembeddings, i.e., embeddings of supermanifolds into supermanifolds. The connection between an embedding procedure and the method of non-linearly realised supersymmetry is clarified, and we demonstrate how the latter arises as a special case of the former. As an illustration, the super-5-brane in 7 dimensions, containing a self-dual 3-form world-volume field strength, is formulated in both languages, and provides an example of a model where the embedding condition does not suffice to put the theory on-shell.

9711204;'Recent results on UV-regularisation through UV-modified uncertainty';'A. Kempf (DAMTP, Cambridge)';'Fri, 28 Nov 1997 20:58:07 GMT   (6kb)';'   Assume that in a fundamental theory of quantum gravity spatial information is encoded through elements x_i of an associative, complex and possibly noncommutative algebra in which the involution acts as x^*_i = x_i. Without further assumptions it can be shown that such x_i can describe only three different types of short distance structures: I. a lattice, II. a continuum or III. a finite lower bound on the uncertainty in positions, as e.g. described in a stringy uncertainty relation. All other cases are mixtures of the three. We briefly review recent results on the case III short distance structure, in particular its ultraviolet regularity and a possible new mechanism that turns the external degrees of freedom lost through the UV-cutoff into internal degrees of freedom.

9711205;'BPS Bounds for Worldvolume Branes';'Jerome P. Gauntlett, Joaquim Gomis and Paul K. Townsend';'Fri, 28 Nov 1997 22:42:49 GMT   (13kb)';'   The worldvolume field equations of M-branes and D-branes are known to admit p-brane soliton solutions. These solitons are shown to saturate a BPS-type bound on their p-volume tensions, which are expressed in terms of central charges that are expected to appear in the worldvolume supertranslation algebra. The cases we consider include vortices, `BIons', instantons and dyons (both abelian and non-abelian), and the string boundaries of M-2-branes in the M-5-brane. '
9712201;'Towards a Noncommutative Geometric Approach to Matrix Compactification';'Pei-Ming Ho, Yi-Yen Wu and Yong-Shi Wu';'Mon, 22 Dec 1997 21:43:37 GMT   (21kb)';'   In this paper we study generic M(atrix) theory compactifications that are specified by a set of quotient conditions. A procedure is proposed, which both associates an algebra to each compactification and leads deductively to general solutions for the matrix variables. The notion of noncommutative geometry on the dual space is central to this construction. As examples we apply this procedure to various orbifolds and orientifolds, including ALE spaces and quotients of tori. While the old solutions are derived in a uniform way, new solutions are obtained in several cases. Our study also leads to a new formulation of gauge theory on quantum spaces. '
9712202;'Infinite Statistics and Black Holes in Matrix Theory';'D. Minic (Penn State)';'Sun, 21 Dec 1997 23:45:08 GMT   (10kb)';'   The concept of infinite statistics is applied to the analysis of black hole thermodynamics in Matrix Theory. It is argued that Matrix Theory partons, D0-branes, satisfy quantum infinite statistics, and that this observation justifies the recently proposed Boltzmann gas model of Schwarzschild black holes in Matrix Theory.

The aim is to prepare the ground for a discussion on anomalies in theories with branes. In this light we review the problem of chiral anomaly cancellation in M-theory with a 5-brane. '

Szabo';'Mon, 22 Dec 1997 14:40:46 GMT   (19kb)';'   We illustrate the various ways in which the algebraic framework of noncommutative geometry naturally captures the short-distance spacetime properties of string theory. We describe the noncommutative spacetime constructed from a vertex operator algebra and show that its algebraic properties bear a striking resemblence to some structures appearing in M Theory, such as the noncommutative torus. We classify the inner automorphisms of the space and show how they naturally imply the conventional duality symmetries of the quantum geometry of spacetime. We examine the problem of constructing a universal gauge group which overlies all of the dynamical symmetries of the string spacetime. We also describe some aspects of toroidal compactifications with a light-like coordinate and show how certain generalized Kac-Moody symmetries, such as the Monster sporadic group, arise as gauge symmetries of the resulting spacetime and of superstring theories.

The construction uses in a crucial way open-string vertex operators that describe non-perturbative brane dynamics. According to our proposal, various gauge theories are described by string theories with the same action, but with different measures in the functional integral. The choice of measure defines the gauge group, as well as the effective space-time dimension of the resulting gauge theory. '

We obtain a completely bosonized expression for the partition function, describing the thermodynamics of the collective modes which are the underlying excitations of this system. From this result we derive closed formulae for the free-energy, specific-heat, two-point correlation functions and momentum distribution, as functionals of electron-electron coupling potentials. '

These states correspond to three-pronged strings connecting three D3-branes. We also find curves of marginal stability in the moduli space of the theory, at which the above states can decay into two 1/2 BPS states. '
9712212;'The Abelian Topological Mass Mechanism From Dimensional Reduction';'Adel Khoudeir';'Mon, 22 Dec 1997 22:22:38 GMT   (4kb)';'   We show that the abelian topological mass mechanism in four dimensions, described by the Cremmer-Sherk action, can be obtained from dimensional reduction in five dimensions. Starting from a gauge invariant action in five dimensions, where the dual equivalence between a massless vector field and a massless second-rank antisymmetric field in five dimensions is established, the dimensional reduction is performed keeping only one massive mode. Furthermore, the Kalb-Ramond action and the Stuckelberger formulation for massive spin-1 are recovered. '
9712213;'Gauge Theory Description of D-brane Black Holes: Emergence of the';'S. F. Hassan, Spenta R. Wadia';'Tue, 23 Dec 1997 02:48:52 GMT   (23kb)';'   We study the hypermultiplet moduli space of an N=4, U(Q_1)xU(Q_5) gauge theory in 1+1 dimensions to extract the effective SCFT description of near extremal 5-dimensional black holes modelled by a collection of D1- and D5-branes. On the moduli space, excitations with fractional momenta arise due to a residual discrete gauge invariance. It is argued that, in the infra-red, the lowest energy excitations are described by an effective c=6, N=4 SCFT on T^4, also valid in the large black hole regime. The ``effective string tension'' is obtained using T-duality covariance. While at the microscopic level, minimal scalars do not couple to (1,5) strings, in the effective theory a coupling is induced by (1,1) and (5,5) strings, leading to Hawking radiation. These considerations imply that, at least for such black holes, the calculation of the Hawking decay rate for minimal scalars has a sound foundation in string theory and statistical mechanics and, hence, there is no information loss.

9712214;'Transmission of Supersymmetry Breaking from a 4-Dimensional Boundary';'Eugene A. Mirabelli and Michael E. Peskin';'Tue, 23 Dec 1997 03:04:08 GMT   (111kb)';'   In the strong-coupling limit of the heterotic string theory constructed by Horava and Witten, an 11-dimensional supergravity theory is coupled to matter multiplets confined to 10-dimensional mirror planes. This structure suggests that realistic unification models are obtained, after compactification of 6 dimensions, as theories of 5-dimensional supergravity in an interval, coupling to matter fields on 4-dimensional walls. Supersymmetry breaking may be communicated from one boundary to another by the 5-dimensional fields. In this paper, we study a toy model of this communication in which 5-dimensional super-Yang-Mills theory in the bulk couples to chiral multiplets on the walls. Using the auxiliary fields of the Yang-Mills multiplet, we find a simple algorithm for coupling the bulk and boundary fields. We demonstrate two different mechanisms for generating soft supersymmetry breaking terms in the boundary theory. We also compute the Casimir energy generated by supersymmetry breaking. '
9712215;'How To Count the States of Extremal Black Holes in N=8 Supergravity';'Vijay Balasubramanian (Harvard U.)';'Tue, 23 Dec 1997 04:08:05 GMT   (30kb)';'   N=8 supergravity has a rich spectrum of black holes charged under the 56 U(1) gauge fields of the theory. Duality predicts that the entropy of these black holes is related to the quartic invariant of the E(7,7) group. We verify this prediction in detail by constructing black holes that correspond to supersymmetric bound states of 2-branes at angles and 6-branes. The general bound state contains an arbitrary number of branes rotated relative to each other, and we derive the condition for these rotations to preserve supersymmetry. The microscopic bound state degeneracy matches the black hole entropy in detail. The entire 56 charge spectrum of extremal black holes in N=8 supergravity can be displayed as the orbit under duality of a five parameter generating solution. We exhibit a new generating configuration consisting of D3-branes at angles and discuss its entropy. '
9712216;'Two component theory and electron magnetic moment';'M. Veltman (Department of Physics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor,';'Tue, 23 Dec 1997 14:05:04 GMT   (21kb)';'   The two-component formulation of quantum electrodynamics is studied. The relation with the usual Dirac formulation is exhibited, and the Feynman rules for the two-component form of the theory are presented in terms of familiar objects. The transformation from the Dirac theory to the two-component theory is quite amusing, involving Faddeev-Popov ghost loops of a fermion type with bose statistics. The introduction of an anomalous magnetic moment in the two-component formalism is simple; it is not equivalent to a Pauli term in the Dirac formulation. Such an anomalous magnetic moment appears not to destroy the renormalizability of the theory but violates unitarity. '

The factor-algebras ${}^{\epsilon}\C_2$ and ${}^{\epsilon}\stackrel{\ast}{\C}_2$, which are obtained by means of homomorphic mappings $\C_3\to\C_2$ and $\C_3\to\stackrel{\ast}{\C}_2$, are identified with the neutrino and antineutrino fields, respectively. In this framework we have natural explanation for absence of right-handed neutrino and left-handed antineutrino. '

9712220;'The perturbations $\phi_{2,1}$ and $\phi_{1,5}$ of the minimal models';'A. Berkovich, B.M. McCoy and P.A. Pearce';'Tue, 23 Dec 1997 19:11:23 GMT   (46kb)';'   We derive the fermionic polynomial generalizations of the characters of the integrable perturbations $\phi_{2,1}$ and $\phi_{1,5}$ of the general minimal $M(p,p')$ conformal field theory by use of the recently discovered trinomial analogue of Bailey's lemma. For $\phi_{2,1}$ perturbations results are given for all models with $2p>p'$ and for $\phi_{1,5}$ perturbations results for all models with ${p'\over 3}<p< {p'\over 2}$ are obtained. For the $\phi_{2,1}$ perturbation of the unitary case $M(p,p+1)$ we use the incidence matrix obtained from these character polynomials to conjecture a set of TBA equations. We also find that for $\phi_{1,5}$ with $2<p'/p < 5/2$ and for $\phi_{2,1}$ satisfying $3p<2p'$ there are usually several different fermionic polynomials which lead to the identical bosonic polynomial. We interpret this to mean that in these cases the specification of the perturbing field is not sufficient to define the theory and that an independent statement of the choice of the proper vacuum must be made.

The expression is obtained by determining the leading corrections in the non-extremality parameter to the corresponding BPS-saturated black hole solutions. These classical results are quantitatively compared with the microscopic leading order corrections to the microscopic result of Maldacena Strominger and Witten for N=2 BPS-saturated black holes. '
9712222;'Non-Linear Integral Equations for complex Affine Toda associated to';'P. Zinn-Justin';'Tue, 23 Dec 1997 22:14:22 GMT   (30kb)';'   A set of coupled non-linear integral equations is derived for a class of models connected with the quantum group $U_q(\hat g)$ ($g$ simply laced Lie algebra), which are solvable using the Bethe Ansatz; these equations describe arbitrary excited states of a system with finite spatial length $L$. They generalize the Destri-De Vega equation for the Sine-Gordon/massive Thirring model to affine Toda field theory with imaginary coupling constant. As an application, the central charge and all the conformal weights of the UV conformal field theory are extracted in a straightforward manner. The quantum group truncation for $q$ at a root of unity is discussed in detail; in the UV limit we recover through this procedure the RCFTs with extended $W(g)$ conformal symmetry. '
9712223;'On the Matrix Description of Calabi-Yau Compactifications';'S. Kachru, A. Lawrence, and E. Silverstein';'Wed, 24 Dec 1997 04:03:11 GMT   (12kb)';'   We point out that the matrix description of M-theory compactified on Calabi-Yau threefolds is in many respects simpler than the matrix description of a $T^6$ compactification. This is largely because of the differences between D6 branes wrapped on Calabi-Yau threefolds and D6 branes wrapped on six-tori. In particular, if we define the matrix theory following the prescription of Sen and Seiberg, we find that the remaining degrees of freedom are decoupled from gravity. '
9712224;'Black hole entropy as T-duality invariant';'Kenji Suzuki (Department of physics, Tokyo Institute of Technology)';'Wed, 24 Dec 1997 06:19:04 GMT   (9kb)';'   We study the Euler numbers and the entropies of the non-extremal intersecting D-branes in ten-dimensions. We use the surface gravity to constrain the compactification radii. We correctly obtain the integer valued Euler numbers for these radii. Moreover, the entropies are found to be invariant under the T-duality transformation. In the extremal limit, we obtain the finite entropies only for two intersecting D-branes. We observe that these entropies are proportional to the product of the charges of each D-brane. We further study the entropies of the boosted metrics. We find that their entropies can be interpreted in term of the microscopic states of D-branes. '

Evans (DAMTP, Cambridge) and Jens Ole Madsen (Universidade';'Wed, 24 Dec 1997 12:18:27 GMT   (31kb)';'   We discuss certain integrable quantum field theories in (1+1)-dimensions consisting of coupled sine/sinh-Gordon theories with N=1 supersymmetry, positive kinetic energy, and bosonic potentials which are bounded from below. We show that theories of this type can be constructed as Toda models based on the exceptional affine Lie superalgebra $D(2,1;\A)^{(1)}$ (or on related algebras which can be obtained as various limits) provided one adopts appropriate reality conditions for the fields. In particular, there is a continuous family of such models in which the couplings and mass ratios all depend on the parameter $\A$. The structure of these models is analyzed in some detail at the classical level, including the construction of conserved currents with spins up to 4. We then show that these currents generalize to the quantum theory, thus demonstrating quantum-integrability of the models. '

It is shown that the Hamiltonian is given as a linear combination of ten first class constraints. The Poisson bracket algebra of these constraints is used to construct the gauge generators. By assuming that the asymptotic symmetry is the global Poincar\'e symmetry, we derived the improved form of the asymptotic generators, and discussed the related conservation laws of energy, momentum, etc. '

We argue that they arise as subsectors of the Coulomb branch of the quiver gauge theory used to describe both string theory D-brane and Matrix theory on an orbifold, and thus must form part of the full physical Hilbert space. We make further observations confirming their interpretation as wrapped membranes. '

The bihamiltonian structure of the hierarchy is given by a classical W-algebra; we compute the central charge of this algebra.

We, on the contrary, propose to introduce a new gauge field $\phi^{(p+2)}$ mediating the interaction, and we have a new type of gauge transformation: $\phi^{(p+2)}\to \phi^{(p+2)} +\delta\Lambda^{(p+3)}$, with $\delta$, a coboundary operator.

Klebanov';'Fri, 26 Dec 1997 17:54:52 GMT   (7kb)';'   Recently, in collaboration with Susskind, we proposed a model of Schwarzschild black holes in Matrix theory. A large Schwarzschild black hole is described by a metastable bound state of a large number of D0-branes which are held together by a background, whose structure has so far been understood only in 8 and 11 dimensions. The Hawking radiation proceeds by emission of small clusters of D0-branes. We estimate the Hawking rate in the Matrix theory model of Schwarzschild black holes and find agreement with the semiclassical rate up to an undetermined numerical coefficient of order 1. '
9712237;'Back Reaction to Rotating Detector';'Takayuki Suga, Riuji Mochizuki and Kenji Ikegami';'Fri, 26 Dec 1997 23:15:26 GMT   (17kb)';'   It has been a puzzle that rotating detector may respond even in the appropriate vacuum defined via canonical quantization. We solve this puzzle by taking back reaction of the detector into account. The influence of the back reaction, even in the detector's mass infinite limit, appears in the response function. It makes the detector possible to respond in the vacuum if the detector is rotating, though the detector in linear uniform motion never respond in the vacuum as expected from Poincare invariance. '
9712238;'On Graviton Scattering Amplitudes in M-Theory';'Katrin Becker and Melanie Becker';'Sat, 27 Dec 1997 00:16:13 GMT   (12kb)';'   We compute graviton scattering amplitudes in M-theory using Feynman rules for a scalar particle coupled to gravity in eleven dimensions. The processes that we consider describe the single graviton exchange and the double graviton exchange, that in M(atrix) theory correspond to the $v^4/r^7$- and $v^6/r^{14}$-term respectively. We further show that the $ v^6/r^{14}$-term appearing in M(atrix) theory at two-loops can be obtained from the covariant eleven-dimensional four-graviton amplitude. Finally, we calculate the $v^8/r^{18}$-term appearing at two-loops in M(atrix) theory. It has been previously conjectured that this term is related to a four graviton scattering amplitude involving the $R^4$-vertex of M-theory. '

Excitations on the boundary are identical to those of ordinary 4-dimensional conformal invariant super electrodynammics. Extrapolations of these excitations give rise to a 5-dimensional topological gauge theory of the singleton type. The possibility of a connection of this phenomenon to the world volume theory of 3-branes in IIB string theory is discussed. '
9712241;'Integrating Over Higgs Branches';'G.Moore, N.Nekrasov, and S.Shatashvili';'Sun, 28 Dec 1997 01:11:24 GMT   (31kb)';'   We develop some useful techinques for integrating over Higgs branches in supersymmetric theories with 4 and 8 supercharges. In particular, we define a regularized volume for hyperkahler quotients. We evaluate this volume for certain ALE and ALF spaces in terms of the hyperkahler periods. We also reduce these volumes for a large class of hyperkahler quotients to simpler integrals. These quotients include complex coadjoint orbits, instanton moduli spaces on $\IR^{4}$ and ALE manifolds, Hitchin spaces, and moduli spaces of parabolic Higgs bundles on Riemann surfaces. In the case of Hitchin spaces the evaluation of the volume reduces to a summation over solutions of Bethe Ansatz equations for the non-linear Schr\"odinger system. We discuss some applications of our results. '

The constraint of unbroken N=1 supersymmetry is imposed. A duality transformation is performed on the resulting consistency conditions. The original equations as well as the transformed equations are solved numerically to obtain new configurations with a nontrivial scale factor and a dynamical dilaton. It is shown that various classes of solutions are possible, which include cosmological solutions with no initial singularity. '

For the renormalized charge and mass we find results which are consistent with the renormalized charge vanishing in the continuum limit. A detailed study of the relation between bare and renormalized quantities reveals that the Landau pole lies in a region of parameter space which is made inaccessible by spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking.

The cases d=3 and 10 are shown to be of prime importance. The explicit solution for d=10 is presented. '
9712248;'Center vortices and confinement vs. screening';'John M. Cornwall';'Mon, 29 Dec 1997 19:22:02 GMT   (25kb)';'   We study adjoint and fundamental Wilson loops in the center-vortex picture of confinement, for gauge group SU(N) with general N. There are N-1 distinct vortices, whose properties, including collective coordinates and actions, we study. In d=2 we construct a center-vortex model by hand so that it has a smooth large-N limit of fundamental-representation Wilson loops and find, as expected, confinement. Extending an earlier work by the author, we construct the adjoint Wilson-loop potential in this d=2 model for all N, as an expansion in powers of $\rho/M^2$, where $\rho$ is the vortex density per unit area and M is the vortex inverse size, and find, as expected, screening. The leading term of the adjoint potential shows a roughly linear regime followed by string breaking when the potential energy is about 2M. This leading potential is a universal (N-independent at fixed fundamental string tension $K_F$) of the form $(K_F/M)U(MR)$, where R is the spacelike dimension of a rectangular Wilson loop. The linear-regime slope is not necessarily related to $K_F$ by Casimir scaling. We show that in d=2 the dilute vortex model is essentially equivalent to true d=2 QCD, but that this is not so for adjoint representations; arguments to the contrary are based on illegal cumulant expansions which fail to represent the necessary periodicity of the Wilson loop in the vortex flux. Most of our arguments are expected to hold in d=3,4 also. '

Originally solitons in the affine Toda models has been found by Olive, Turok and Underwood. Single solitons are created by exponentials of elements which ad-diagonalize the principal Heisenberg subalgebra. Alternatively Babelon and Bernard exploited the dressing symmetry to reproduce the known expressions for the fundamental tau functions in the sine-Gordon model. In this paper we show the equivalence between these two methods to construct solitons in the $A_n^{(n)}$ Toda models. '
9712250;'The spacetime attribute of matter';'Borge Nodland';'Tue, 30 Dec 1997 03:48:04 GMT   (7kb)';'   We propose that spacetime is fundamentally a property of matter, inseparable from it. This leads us to suggest that all properties of matter must be elevated to the same status as that of spacetime in quantum field theories of matter. We suggest a specific method for extending field theories to accomodate this, and point out how this leads to the evolution of fields through channels other than the spacetime channel. '
9712251;'Black Hole Entropy from Near-Horizon Microstates';'Andrew Strominger';'Tue, 30 Dec 1997 21:48:15 GMT   (10kb)';'   Black holes whose near-horizon geometries are locally, but not necessarily globally, AdS$_3$ (three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space) are considered. Using the fact that quantum gravity on AdS$_3$ is a conformal field theory, we microscopically compute the black hole entropy from the asymptotic growth of states. Precise numerical agreement with the Bekenstein-Hawking area formula for the entropy is found. The result pertains to any consistent quantum theory of gravity, and does not use string theory or supersymmetry. '

9712254;'Twisted Self-Duality of Dimensionally Reduced Gravity and Vertex';'D. Bernard and B.

We introduce another solution generating group for these equations, the dressing group, and discuss its connection with the Geroch group. We show that it acts transitively on a dense subset of moduli space. We use a new Lax pair expressing a twisted self-duality of this system and we study the dressing problem associated to it. We also describe how to use vertex operators to solve the reduced Einstein's equations. In particular this allows to find solutions by purely algebraic computations. '

A new type of derivative multi-component nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation emerges as effective description of the system that supports novel chiral solitons.

With the help of a reflection amplitude that follows from the structure constants one obtains a proposal for the fusion rules from canonical quantization. Taken together these pieces of information allow an unambigous definition of any genus zero n-point function. '
9712257;'Branes: from free fields to general backgrounds';'J. Fuchs, C. Schweigert';'Wed, 31 Dec 1997 12:04:11 GMT   (64kb)';'   Motivated by recent developments in string theory, we study the structure of boundary conditions in arbitrary conformal field theories. A boundary condition is specified by two types of data: first, a consistent collection of reflection coefficients for bulk fields on the disk; and second, a choice of an automorphism $\omega$ of the fusion rules that preserves conformal weights. Non-trivial automorphisms $\omega$ correspond to D-brane configurations for arbitrary conformal field theories. The choice of the fusion rule automorphism $\omega$ amounts to fixing the dimension and certain global topological features of the D-brane world volume and the background gauge field on it. We present evidence that for fixed choice of $\omega$ the boundary conditions are classified as the irreducible representations of some commutative associative algebra, a generalization of the fusion rule algebra. Each of these irreducible representations corresponds to a choice of the moduli for the world volume of the D-brane and the moduli of the flat connection on it. '
9712258;'The Mini-Superspace Limit of the SL(2,C)/SU(2)-WZNW Model';'J. Teschner';'Wed, 31 Dec 1997 16:54:36 GMT   (20kb)';'   Many qualitatively new features of WZNW models associated to noncompact cosets are due to zero modes with continuous spectrum. Insight may be gained by reducing the theory to its zero-mode sector, the mini-superspace limit. This will be discussed in some detail for the example of SL(2,C)/SU(2)-WZNW model. The mini-superspace limit of this model can be formulated as baby-CFT. Spectrum, structure constants and fusion rules as well as factorization of four point functions are obtained from the harmonic analysis on SL(2,C)/SU(2). The issues of operator-state correspondence or the appearance of non-normalizable intermediate states in correlation functions can be discussed transparently in this context. '

Particularly, the web of constraints which follow from supersymmetry and anomaly cancelation is argued to be more rich than previously understood. In contradistinction to the lore on the subject, a consistent classical theory describing the coupling of eleven dimensional supergravity to super Yang-Mills theory constrained to the orbifold fixed points is suggested to exist.

9801205;'Open string - string junction transitions';'Matthias R. Gaberdiel, Tamas Hauer and Barton Zwiebach';'Fri, 30 Jan 1998 20:31:43 GMT   (44kb)';'   It is confirmed that geodesic string junctions are necessary to describe the gauge vectors of symmetry groups that arise in the context of IIB superstrings compactified in the presence of nonlocal 7-branes. By examining the moduli space of 7-brane backgrounds for which the dilaton and axion fields are constant, we are able to describe explicitly and geometrically how open string geodesics can fail to be smooth, and how geodesic string junctions then become the relevant BPS representatives of the gauge bosons. The mechanisms that guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the BPS representative of any gauge vector are also shown to generalize to the case where the dilaton and axion fields are not constant.

9801206;'Conformal Theory of M2, D3, M5 and `D1+D5' Branes';'P. Claus, R. Kallosh, J. Kumar, P.K. Townsend and A. Van Proeyen';'Fri, 30 Jan 1998 21:50:59 GMT   (23kb)';'   The bosonic actions for M2, D3 and M5 branes in their own d-dimensional near-horizon background are given in a manifestly SO(p+1,2) x SO(d-p-1) invariant form (p=2,3,5). These symmetries result from a breakdown of ISO(d,2) (with d=10 for D3 and d=11 for M2 and M5) symmetry by the Wess-Zumino term and constraints. The new brane actions, reduce after gauge-fixing and solving constraints to (p+1) dimensional interacting field theories with a non-linearly realized SO(p+1,2) conformal invariance. We also present an interacting two-dimensional conformal field theory on a D-string in the near-horizon geometry of a D1+D5 configuration. '
9801207;'Gauge Theories with Tensors from Branes and Orientifolds';'Csaba Csaki (UC Berkeley), Martin Schmaltz (Boston Univ.), Witold';'Sat, 31 Jan 1998 00:25:53 GMT   (31kb)';'   We present brane constructions in Type IIA string theory for N=1 supersymmetric SO and Sp gauge theories with tensor representations using an orientifold 6-plane. One limit of these set-ups corresponds to N=2 theories previously constructed by Landsteiner and Lopez, while a different limit yields N=1 SO or Sp theories with a massless tensor and no superpotential. For the Sp-type orientifold projection comparison with the field theory moduli space leads us to postulate two new rules governing the stability of configurations of D-branes intersecting the orientifold. Lifting one of our configurations to M-theory by finding the corresponding curves, we re-derive the N=1 dualities for SO and Sp groups using semi-infinite D4 branes. '
9802201;'On the Classification of Real Forms of Non-Abelian Toda Theories and';'J.M. Evans (DAMTP, University of Cambridge) and J.O. Madsen';'Fri, 27 Feb 1998 19:29:19 GMT   (45kb)';'   We consider conformal non-Abelian Toda theories obtained by hamiltonian reduction from Wess-Zumino-Witten models based on general real Lie groups. We study in detail the possible choices of reality conditions which can be imposed on the WZW or Toda fields and prove correspondences with sl(2,R) embeddings into real Lie algebras and with the possible real forms of the associated W-algebras. We devise a a method for finding all real embeddings which can be obtained from a given embedding of sl(2,C) into a complex Lie algebra. We then apply this to give a complete classification of real embeddings which are principal in some simple regular subalgebra of a classical Lie algebra. '

The boundary fields are described in terms of N=4 superconformal Yang-Mills theory and the proposed correspondence between supergravity in $AdS_5$ and superconformal invariant singleton theory at the boundary is formulated in an N=4 superfield covariant language.

9802204;'Construction Formulae for Singular Vectors of the Topological N=2';'Beatriz Gato-Rivera';'Fri, 27 Feb 1998 19:49:36 GMT   (14kb)';'   The Topological N=2 Superconformal algebra has 29 different types of singular vectors (in complete Verma modules) distinguished by the relative U(1) charge and the BRST-invariance properties of the vector and of the primary on which it is built. Whereas one of these types only exists at level zero, the remaining 28 types exist for general levels and can be constructed already at level 1. In this paper we write down one-to-one mappings between 16 of these types of topological singular vectors and the singular vectors of the Antiperiodic NS algebra. As a result one obtains construction formulae for these 16 types of topological singular vectors using the construction formulae for the NS singular vectors due to Doerrzapf. '
9803201;'Quantum Kramers-Wannier Duality And Its Topology';'Pavol Severa';'Wed, 25 Mar 1998 13:17:45 GMT   (29kb)';'   We show for any oriented surface, possibly with a boundary, how to generalize Kramers-Wannier duality to the world of quantum groups. The generalization is motivated by quantization of Poisson-Lie T-duality from the string theory. Cohomologies with quantum coefficients are defined for surfaces and their meaning is revealed. They are functorial with respect to some glueing operations and connected with q-invariants of 3-folds. '
9803202;'Background Harmonic Superfields in N=2 Supergravity';'B.M.Zupnik';'Wed, 25 Mar 1998 13:47:13 GMT   (16kb)';'   A modification of the harmonic superfield formalism in $D=4, N=2$ supergravity using a subsidiary condition of covariance under the background supersymmetry with a central charge ($B$-covariance) is considered. Conservation of analyticity together with the $B$-covariance leads to the appearance of linear gravitational superfields. Analytic prepotentials arise in a decomposition of the background linear superfields in terms of spinor coordinates and transform in a nonstandard way under the background supersymmetry. The linear gravitational superfields can be written via spinor derivatives of nonanalytic spinor prepotentials. The perturbative expansion of the extended supergravity action in terms of the $B$-covariant superfields and the corresponding version of the differential-geometric formalism are considered. We discuss the dual harmonic representation of the linearized extended supergravity, which corresponds to the dynamical condition of Grassmann analyticity. '
9803203;'Branes as BIons';'G W Gibbons';'Wed, 25 Mar 1998 14:07:27 GMT   (8kb)';'   A BIon may be defined as a finite energy solution of a non-linear field theory with distributional sources. By contrast a soliton is usually defined to have no sources. I show how harmonic coordinates map the exteriors of the topologically and causally non-trivial spacetimes of extreme p-branes to BIonic solutions of the Einstein equations in a topologically trivial spacetime in which the combined gravitational and matter energy momentum is located on distributional sources. As a consequence the tension of BPS p-branes is classically unrenormalized. The result holds equally for spacetimes with singularities and for those, like the M-5-brane, which are everywhere singularity free. '
9803204;'Effect of Zero Modes on the Bound-State Spectrum in Light-Cone';'A.S. Mueller, A.C. Kalloniatis, H.-C. Pauli';'Wed, 25 Mar 1998 15:14:18 GMT   (43kb)';'   We study the role of bosonic zero modes in light-cone quantisation on the invariant mass spectrum for the simplified setting of two-dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills theory coupled to massive scalar adjoint matter. Specifically, we use discretised light-cone quantisation where the momentum modes become discrete. Two types of zero momentum mode appear -- constrained and dynamical zero modes. In fact only the latter type of modes turn out to mix with the Fock vacuum. Omission of the constrained modes leads to the dynamical zero modes being controlled by an infinite square-well potential. We find that taking into account the wavefunctions for these modes in the computation of the full bound state spectrum of the two dimensional theory leads to 21% shifts in the masses of the lowest lying states.

9803205;'Gravitational Anomaly Cancellation for M-Theory Fivebranes';'D. Freed, J. A. Harvey, R. Minasian, G. Moore';'Wed, 25 Mar 1998 23:11:57 GMT   (16kb)';'   We study gravitational anomalies for fivebranes in M theory. We show that an apparent anomaly in diffeomorphisms acting on the normal bundle is cancelled by a careful treatment of the M theory Chern-Simons coupling in the presence of fivebranes. One interesting aspect of our treatment is the way in which a magnetic object (the fivebrane) is smoothed out through coupling to gravity and the resulting relation between antisymmetric tensor gauge transformations and diffeomorphisms in the presence of a fivebrane.

9803206;'Wrapping Branes in Space and Time';'G W Gibbons';'Wed, 25 Mar 1998 16:41:10 GMT   (11kb)';'   Branes may be approximated semi-classically by solutions of supergravity theories with event and Cauchy horizons. I suggest that if one wishes to avoid singularities and to capture accurately some of the properties of branes then these classical spacetimes must be identified so as to render them periodic in time.

The total system of constraints in such theory includes both the first and the second class constraints. The corresponding nilpotent BRST charge contains terms up to the seventh degree in ghosts. '
9803208;'New Gauge Invariant Formulation of the Chern-Simons Gauge Theory';'Mu-In Park (MIT & LNS) and Young-Jai Park (Sogang Univ.)';'Wed, 25 Mar 1998 17:53:25 GMT   (10kb)';'   A new gauge invariant formulation of the relativistic scalar field interacting with Chern-Simons gauge fields is considered. This formulation is consistent with the gauge fixed formulation. Furthermore we find that canonical (Noether) Poincar\'e generators are not gauge invariant even on the constraints surface and do not satisfy the (classical) Poincar\'e algebra. It is the improved generators, constructed from the symmetric energy-momentum tensor, which are (manifestly) gauge invariant and obey the classical Poincar\'e algebra. '
9803209;'Superspace Geometry for Supermembrane Backgrounds';'Bernard de Wit, Kasper Peeters, Jan Plefka';'Wed, 25 Mar 1998 23:27:33 GMT   (25kb)';'   We construct part of the superspace vielbein and tensor gauge field in terms of the component fields of 11-dimensional on-shell supergravity. The result can be utilized to describe supermembranes and corresponding matrix models for Dirichlet particles in nontrivial supergravity backgrounds to second order in anticommuting coordinates. We exhibit the kappa-invariance of the corresponding supermembrane action, which at this order holds for unrestricted supergravity backgrounds, the supersymmetry covariance and the resulting surface terms in the action.

9803210;'Open inflation and the singular boundary';'Jaume Garriga';'Wed, 25 Mar 1998 18:00:43 GMT   (5kb)';'   The singularity in Hawking and Turok's model (hep-th/9802030) of open inflation has some appealing properties. We suggest that this singularity should be regularized with matter. The singular instanton can then be obtained as the limit of a family of ``no-boundary'' solutions where both the geometry and the scalar field are regular. Using this procedure, the contribution of the singularity to the Euclidean action is just 1/3 of the Gibbons-Hawking boundary term. Unrelated to this question, we also point out that gravitational backreaction improves the behaviour of scalar perturbations near the singularity. As a result, the problem of quantizing scalar perturbations and gravity waves seems to be very well posed. '
9803211;'Infrared divergence in QED$_3$ at finite temperature';'Dominic Lee, Georgios Metikas';'Wed, 25 Mar 1998 18:03:38 GMT   (192kb)';'   We consider various ways of treating the infrared divergence which appears in the dynamically generated fermion mass, when the transverse part of the photon propagator in N flavour $QED_{3}$ at finite temperature is included in the Matsubara formalism. This divergence is likely to be an artefact of taking into account only the leading order term in the $1 \over N$ expansion when we calculate the photon propagator and is handled here phenomenologically by means of an infrared cutoff. Inserting both the longitudinal and the transverse part of the photon propagator in the Schwinger-Dyson equation we find the dependence of the dynamically generated fermion mass on the temperature and the cutoff parameters. It turns out that consistency with certain statistical physics arguments imposes conditions on the cutoff parameters. For parameters in the allowed range of values we find that the ratio $r=2*Mass(T=0)/critical temperature$ is approximately 6, consistently with previous calculations which neglected the transverse photon contribution.

9803212;'Wilsonian Flow and Mass-Independent Renormalization';'M.Pernici and M. Raciti';'Wed, 25 Mar 1998 19:22:36 GMT   (27kb)';'   We derive the Gell-Mann and Low renormalization group equation in the Wilsonian approach to renormalization of massless $g\phi^4$ in four dimensions, as a particular case of a non-linear equation satisfied at any scale by the Wilsonian effective action.   We give an exact expression for the $\beta$ and $\gamma_{\phi}$ functions in terms of the Wilsonian effective action at the Wilsonian renormalization scale $\L_R$; at the first two loops they are simply related to the gradient of the flow of the relevant couplings and have the standard values; beyond two loops this relation is spoilt by corrections due to irrelevant couplings. We generalize this analysis to the case of massive $g\phi^4$, introducing a mass-independent Wilsonian renormalization scheme; using the flow equation technique we prove renormalizability and we show that the limit of vanishing mass parameter exists. We derive the corresponding renormalization group equation, in which $\beta$ and $\gamma_{\phi}$ are the same as in the massless case; $\gamma_m$ is also mass-independent; at one loop it is the gradient of a relevant coupling and it has the expected value.

9803213;'3-particle Calogero Model: Supertraces and Ideals on the Algebra of';'S.E.Konstein';'Wed, 25 Mar 1998 20:19:32 GMT   (10kb)';'   The associative superalgebra of observables of 3-particle Calogero model giving all wavefunctions of the model via standard Fock procedure has 2 independent supertraces. It is shown here that when the coupling constant \nu is equal to n+1/3, n-1/3 or n+1/2 for any integer n the existence of 2 independent supertraces leads to existence of nontrivial two-sided ideal in the superalgebra of observables.

9803214;'Gauge Theories from Orientifolds and Large N Limit';'Zurab Kakushadze';'Wed, 25 Mar 1998 22:52:39 GMT   (89kb)';'   Extending the recent work in hep-th/9803076, we consider string perturbative expansion in the presence of D-branes and orientifold planes imbedded in orbifolded space-time. In the $\alpha'\to 0$ limit the weak coupling string perturbative expansion maps to `t Hooft's large N expansion. We focus on four dimensional ${\cal N}=1,2,4$ supersymmetric theories, and also discuss possible extensions to ${\cal N}=0$ cases. Utilizing the string theory perturbation techniques we show that computation of any M-point correlation function in these theories reduces to the corresponding computation in the parent ${\cal N}=4$ theory. In particular, we discuss theories (which are rather constrained) with vanishing beta-functions to all orders in perturbation theory in the large N limit. We also point out that in theories with non-vanishing beta-functions the gauge coupling running is suppressed in the large N limit. Introduction of orientifold planes allows to construct certain gauge theories with SO, Sp and SU gauge groups and various matter (only unitary gauge groups with bi-fundamental/adjoint matter arise in theories without orientifold planes).

9803215;'Quantum Probes of Repulsive Singularities in N = 2 Supergravity';'Ingo Gaida (DAMTP, University of Cambridge)';'Thu, 26 Mar 1998 09:14:07 GMT   (11kb)';'   Repulsive singularities (repulsons) in extended supergravity theories are investigated. These repulsive singularities are related to attractive singularities (black holes) in moduli space of extended supergravity vacua. In order to study these repulsive singularities a scalar test-particle in the background of a repulson is investigated. It is shown, using a partial wave expansion, that the wave function of the scalar particle vanishes at the curvature singularity at the origin. In addition the connection to higher dimensional p-brane solutions including anti-branes is discussed. '

By considering configurations of intersecting fivebranes and hence intersecting threebrane solitons, we determine the Bogomol'nyi equations for more general BPS configurations. We obtain differential equations, generalising Cauchy-Riemann equations, which imply that the worldvolume of the fivebrane is wrapped around a calibrated geometry. '
9803217;'Integrable Hierarchies and Contact Terms in u-plane Integrals of';'Kanehisa Takasaki (Kyoto University)';'Thu, 26 Mar 1998 11:23:24 GMT   (12kb)';'   The $u$-plane integrals of topologically twisted $N = 2$ supersymmetric gauge theories generally contain contact terms of nonlocal topological observables. This paper proposes an interpretation of these contact terms from the point of view of integrable hierarchies and their Whitham deformations. This is inspired by Mari\~no and Moore's remark that the blowup formula of the $u$-plane integral contains a piece that can be interpreted as a single-time tau function of an integrable hierarchy. This single-time tau function can be extended to a multi-time version without spoiling the modular invariance of the blowup formula. The multi-time tau function is comprised of a Gaussian factor $e^{Q(t_1,t_2,...)}$ and a theta function. The time variables $t_n$ play the role of physical coupling constants of 2-observables $I_n(B)$ carried by the exceptional divisor $B$. The coefficients $q_{mn}$ of the Gaussian part are identified to be the contact terms of these 2-observables. This identification is further examined in the language of Whitham equations. All relevant quantities are written in the form of derivatives of the prepotential. '

An analysis of the gauge structure, reducibility conditions and physical degrees of freedom is presented. We employ the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism to quantize the resulting theory. '

9803221;'P,T-invariant system of Chern-Simons fields: Pseudoclassical model and';'Khazret Nirov and Mikhail Plyushchay';'Thu, 26 Mar 1998 17:57:06 GMT   (23kb)';'   We investigate hidden symmetries of P,T-invariant system of topologically massive U(1) gauge fields. For this purpose, we propose a pseudoclassical model giving rise to this field system at the quantum level. The model contains a parameter, which displays a quantization property at the classical and the quantum levels and demonstrates a nontrivial relationship between continuous and discrete symmetries. Analyzing the integrals of motion of the pseudoclassical model, we identify U(1,1) symmetry and S(2,1) supersymmetry as hidden symmetries of the corresponding quantum system. Representing the hidden symmetries in a covariant form, we show that one-particle states realize an irreducible representation of a non-standard super-extension of the (2+1)-dimensional Poincare group labelled by the zero eigenvalue of the superspin.

9803222;'Faddeev-Jackiw approach to gauge theories and ineffective constraints';'J. Antonio Garc\'ia and Josep M. Pons';'Thu, 26 Mar 1998 18:23:07 GMT   (19kb)';'   The general conditions for the applicability of the Faddeev-Jackiw approach to gauge theories are studied. When the constraints are effective a new proof in the Lagrangian framework of the equivalence between this method and the Dirac approach is given. We find, however, that the two methods may give different descriptions for the reduced phase space when ineffective constraints are present. In some cases the Faddeev-Jackiw approach may lose some constraints or some equations of motion. We believe that this inequivalence can be related to the failure of the Dirac conjecture (that says that the Dirac Hamiltonian can be enlarged to an Extended Hamiltonian including all first class constraints, without changes in the dynamics) and we suggest that when the Dirac conjecture fails the Faddeev-Jackiw approach fails to give the correct dynamics. Finally we present some examples that illustrate this inequivalence. '
9803223;'Renormalization Ambiguities in Casimir Energy';'Luiz C. de Albuquerque (University of Sao Paulo)';'Thu, 26 Mar 1998 20:10:59 GMT   (10kb)';'   Some questions were recently raised about the equivalence of two methods commonly used to compute the Casimir energy: the mode summation approach and the one-loop effective potential. In this respect, we argue that the scale dependence induced by renormalization effects, displayed by the effective potential approach, also appears in the MS method. '
9803224;'Chiral matter and transitions in heterotic string models';'G. Curio';'Thu, 26 Mar 1998 20:59:37 GMT   (16kb)';'   In the framework of N=1 supersymmetric string models given by the heterotic string on an elliptic Calabi-Yau $\pi :Z\ra B$ together with a SU(n) bundle we compute the chiral matter content of the massless spectrum. For this purpose the net generation number, i.e. half the third Chern class, is computed from data related to the heterotic vector bundle in the spectral cover description; a non-technical introduction to that method is supplied. This invariant is, in the class of bundles considered, shown to be related to a discrete modulus which is the heterotic analogue of the $F$-theory four-flux. We consider also the relevant matter which is supported along certain curves in the base $B$ and derive the net generation number again from the independent matter-related computation. We then illustrate these considerations with two applications. First we show that the construction leads to numerous 3 generation models of unbroken gauge group $SU(5), SO(10)$ or $E_6$. Secondly we discuss the closely related issue of the heterotic 5-brane/instanton transition resp. the F-theoretic 3-brane/instanton transition. The extra chiral matter in these transitions is related to the Hecke transform of the direct sum of the original bundle and the dissolved 5-brane along the intersection of their spectral covers. Finally we point to the corresponding $F$-theory interpretation of chiral matter from the intersection of 7-branes where the influence of four-flux on the twisting along the intersection curve plays a crucial role.

9803225;'Towards Deriving Higgs Lagrangian from Gauge Theories';'Noriaki Kitazawa and Francesco Sannino (Yale Univ.)';'Thu, 26 Mar 1998 22:26:42 GMT   (36kb)';'   A new method of deriving the Higgs Lagrangian from vector-like gauge theories is explored. After performing a supersymmetric extension of gauge theories we identify the auxiliary field associated with the "meson" superfield, in the low energy effective theory, as the composite Higgs field. The auxiliary field, at tree level, has a "negative squared mass". By computing the one-loop effective action in the low energy effective theory, we show that a kinetic term for the auxiliary field emerges when an explicit non-perturbative mechanism for supersymmetry breaking is introduced. We find that, due to the naive choice of the Kaehler potential, the Higgs potential remains unbounded from the below. A possible scenario for solving this problem is presented. It is also shown that once chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken via a non-zero vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field, the low energy composite fermion field acquires a mass and decouples, while in the supersymmetric limit it was kept massless by the 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions.

The general structure in momentum space of the fermion mass operator with external electromagnetic field is discussed. Using it we find the solutions of the ladder WT identity with magnetic field. The consistency of our results with the solutions of the corresponding Schwinger-Dyson equation ensures the gauge invariance of the magnetic field induced chiral symmetry breaking recently found in ladder QED.

These include minimally coupled scalar, conformally coupled scalar, dilaton, and tachyon. To calculate the decay rate of the BTZ black hole, we consider both the Dirichlet boundary condition at spatial infinity and the stability condition. It turns out that the tachyon may be a relevant field to get information of the BTZ black hole. '

In two examples we consider all the periods in and around the rigid limit, identifying the nontrivial ones in the limit as periods of a meromorphic form on the relevant Riemann surfaces. We show how the Kahler potential of the special Kahler manifold reduces to that of a rigid special Kahler manifold. We extensively make use of the structure of these Calabi-Yau manifolds as K3 fibrations, which is useful to obtain the periods even before the K3 degenerates to an ALE manifold in the limit. We study various methods to calculate the periods and their properties. The development of these methods is an important step to obtain exact results from supergravity on Calabi-Yau manifolds. '
9803229;'Loop Quantum Mechanics and the Fractal Structure of Quantum Spacetime';'S.Ansoldi, A.Aurilia, E.Spallucci';'Fri, 27 Mar 1998 10:23:02 GMT   (61kb)';'   We discuss the relation between string quantization based on the Schild path integral and the Nambu-Goto path integral. The equivalence between the two approaches at the classical level is extended to the quantum level by a saddle--point evaluation of the corresponding path integrals. A possible relationship between M-Theory and the quantum mechanics of string loops is pointed out. Then, within the framework of ``loop quantum mechanics'', we confront the difficult question as to what exactly gives rise to the structure of spacetime. We argue that the large scale properties of the string condensate are responsible for the effective Riemannian geometry of classical spacetime. On the other hand, near the Planck scale the condensate ``evaporates'', and what is left behind is a ``vacuum'' characterized by an effective fractal geometry. '

The geometrical structure of the underlying manifold is investigated and the one-loop divergent contribution to the effective action is computed. The condition of vanishing beta-function allows to identify a class of models which satisfy this requirement and possess N=4 supersymmetry. '

We describe how all these solutions are connected through the addition of a wave and/or monopoles. All solutions exhibit supersymmetry enhancement near the horizon. Furthermore we argue that string theory on these spaces is dual to specific superconformal field theories in two dimensions whose symmetry algebra in all cases contains the large N=4 algebra A_{gamma}. Implications for gauged supergravities are also discussed. '

The last piece in the puzzle is a T-duality relating arbitrary Hanany-Witten setups and fractional branes. '
9803233;'Decay of Spatial Correlations in Thermal States';'Christian Jaekel';'Fri, 27 Mar 1998 15:56:57 GMT   (15kb)';'   We study the cluster properties of thermal equilibrium states in theories with a maximal propagation velocity (such as relativistic QFT). Our analysis, carried out in the setting of algebraic quantum field theory, shows that there is a tight relation between spectral properties of the generator of time translations and the decay of spatial correlations in thermal equilibrium states, in complete analogy to the well understood case of the vacuum state.

9803234;'Parafermionic Reductions of WZW Model';'J.F. Gomes, G.M. Sotkov and A. H. Zimerman';'Fri, 27 Mar 1998 19:08:34 GMT   (63kb)';'   We investigate a class of conformal Non-Abelian-Toda models representing a noncompact $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ parafermionions (PF) interacting with a specific abelian Toda theories and having a global U(1) symmetry. A systematic derivation of the conserved currents, their algebras and the exact solution of these models is presented. An important property of this class of models is the affine $SL(2,R)_q$ algebra spanned by charges of the chiral and antichiral nonlocal currents and the U(1) charge. The classical (Poisson Brackets) algebras of symmetries $V{G_n}$ of these models appears to be of mixed PF-$W{G_n}$ type. They contain together with the local quadratic terms specific for the $W_n$-algebras the nonlocal terms similar to the ones of the classical PF-algebra. The renormalization of the spins of the nonlocal currents is the main new feature of the quantum $V{A_n}$-algebras. The quantum $V{A_2}$-algebra and its degenerate representations are studied in detail. '
9803235;'The Universe as a Domain Wall';'Andre Lukas, Burt A. Ovrut, K.S. Stelle and Daniel Waldram';'Fri, 27 Mar 1998 23:37:18 GMT   (19kb)';'   It is shown that the effective five-dimensional theory of the strongly coupled heterotic string is a gauged version of N=1 five-dimensional supergravity with four-dimensional boundaries. For the universal supermultiplets, this theory is explicitly constructed by a generalized dimensional reduction procedure on a Calabi-Yau manifold. A crucial ingredient in the reduction is the retention of a "non-zero mode" of the four-form field strength, leading to the gauging of the universal hypermultiplet by the graviphoton. We show that this theory has an exact three-brane domain wall solution which reduces to Witten's "deformed" Calabi-Yau background upon linearization. This solution consists of two parallel three-branes with sources provided by the four-dimensional boundary theories and constitutes the appropriate background for a reduction to four dimensions. Four-dimensional space-time is then identified with the three-brane worldvolume. '

We then construct a fermion Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory which has consistent static field equations, and show that it has the same vortex solutions as the Jackiw-Pi model, but gives rise to quite different vortex dynamics.

9803237;'Renormalization of Functional Schroedinger Equation by Background Field';'K.Zarembo';'Sat, 28 Mar 1998 03:13:00 GMT   (9kb)';'   Renormalization group transformations for Schr\"odinger equation are performed in $\phi^4$ and in Yang-Mills theories. The dependence of the ground state wave functional on rapidly oscillating fields is found. For Yang-Mills theory, this dependence restricts a possible form of variational ansatz compatible with asymptotic freedom. '
9803238;'Weak Field Expansion of Gravity: Graphs, Matrices and Topology';'Shoichi Ichinose and Noriaki Ikeda';'Sat, 28 Mar 1998 07:51:14 GMT   (175kb)';'   We present some approaches to the perturbative analysis of the classical and quantum gravity. First we introduce a graphical representation for a global SO(n) tensor $(\pl)^d h_\ab$, which generally appears in the weak field expansion around the flat space: $g_\mn=\del_\mn+h_\mn$. Making use of this representation, we explain 1) Generating function of graphs (Feynman diagram approach), 2) Adjacency matrix (Matrix approach), 3) Graphical classification in terms of "topology indices" (Topology approach), 4) The Young tableau (Symmetric group approach). We systematically construct the global SO(n) invariants. How to show the independence and completeness of those invariants is the main theme. We explain it taking simple examples of $\pl\pl h-, {and} (\pl\pl h)^2-$ invariants in the text. The results are applied to the analysis of the independence of general invariants and (the leading order of) the Weyl anomalies of scalar-gravity theories in "diverse" dimensions (2,4,6,8,10 dimensions).

After discussing several toy models, we will reformulate in our framework the standard model based on Connes' real structure. It is shown that for the most general bosonic lagrangin which is required to also reconstruct N=2 super Yang-Mills theory Higgs mechanism operates only for more than one generation as first pointed out by Connes and Lott.

Therefore such finite W algebras appear as realisations of Yangians. This result is useful to determine properties of such W algebra representations. '

We show how this result can be applied to determine properties of the finite dimensional representations of such W-algebras. '
9803245;'The Relation Between KMS-states for Different Temperatures';'Christian Jaekel';'Mon, 30 Mar 1998 14:53:10 GMT   (25kb)';'   Given a thermal field theory for a certain temperature, we present a method to construct the theory at any finite positive temperature provided the number of local degrees of freedom is restricted in a physically sensible manner. Our work is based on a construction invented by Buchholz and Junglas [BJu 89]. Starting from the vacuum representation, they established the existence of thermal equilibrium states (KMS-states) for a large class of quantum field theories. The KMS-states were constructed as limit points of nets of states which represented strictly localized excitations of the vacuum. We adjust their method to the general structure of thermal quantum field theories. In a first step we construct states which closely resemble KMS-states for the new temperature in a local region $\O_\circ \subset \r^4$, but coincide with the given KMS-state in the space-like complement of a slightly larger region $\hat{\O}$. By a weak^*-compactness argument there always exists a convergent subsequence of states as the size of $\O_\circ$ and $\hat{\O}$ tends towards $\r^4$. Whether or not the limit state of such a subsequence is a global KMS-states for the new temperature, depends on the surface energy contained in the layer in between the boundaries of $\O_\circ^{(i)}$ and $\hat{\O}^{(i)}$ as $i \to \infty$. This surface energy is controlled by a generalized cluster theorem. '
9803246;'Vanishing of Gravitational Particle Production in the Formation of';'I. Brevik and B. Jensen';'Mon, 30 Mar 1998 16:08:59 GMT   (8kb)';'   We consider the gravitationally induced particle production from the quantum vacuum which is defined by a free, massless and minimally coupled scalar field during the formation of a gauge cosmic string. Previous discussions of this topic estimate the power output per unit length along the string to be of the order of $10^{68}$ ergs/sec/cm in the s-channel. We find that this production may be completely suppressed. A similar result is also expected to hold for the number of produced photons. '

Helayel-Neto and';'Mon, 30 Mar 1998 15:31:37 GMT   (15kb)';'   The ``extended'' BF-Yang-Mills theory in 3 dimensions, which contains a minimally coupled scalar field, is shown to be ultraviolet finite. It obeys a trivial Callan-Symanzik equation, with all beta-functions and anomalous dimensions vanishing. The proof is based on an anomaly-free trace identity valid to all orders of perturbation theory. '
9803248;'Inverse scattering and solitons in $A_{n-1}$ affine Toda field theories';'E.J.Beggs, P.R.Johnson';'Mon, 30 Mar 1998 16:42:39 GMT   (40kb)';'   New single soliton solutions to the affine Toda field theories are constructed, exhibiting previously unobserved topological charges. This goes some of the way in filling the weights of the fundamental representations, but nevertheless holes in the representations remain. We use the group doublecross product form of the inverse scattering method, and restrict ourselves to the rank one solutions. '
9803249;'Large N limit of orbifold field theories';'Michael Bershadsky and Andrei Johansen';'Mon, 30 Mar 1998 18:31:16 GMT   (79kb)';'   We consider certain orbifoldization of the ${\cal N}=4$ field theories that leads to ${\cal N}=2,1,0$ field theories in 4 dimensions. These theories were recently analyzed using the string theory perturbation technique. It was found that in the large $N$ limit all correlation functions of the orbifold theories coincide with those of ${\cal N}=4$, modulo the rescaling of the gauge coupling constant. In this paper we repeat the same analysis using the field theoretical language. '
9803250;'Quark confinement and color transparency in a gauge-invariant';'Lusheng Chen and Kurt Haller (University of Connecticut)';'Mon, 30 Mar 1998 19:35:51 GMT   (17kb)';'   We examine a nonlocal interaction that results from expressing the QCD Hamiltonian entirely in terms of gauge-invariant quark and gluon fields. The interaction couples one quark color-charge density to another, much as electric charge densities are coupled to each other by the Coulomb interaction in QED. In QCD, this nonlocal interaction also couples quark color-charge densities to gluonic color. We show how the leading part of the interaction between quark color-charge densities vanishes when the participating quarks are in a color singlet configuration, and that, for singlet configurations, the residual interaction weakens as the size of a packet of quarks shrinks. Because of this effect, color-singlet packets of quarks should experience final state interactions that increase in strength as these packets expand in size. For the case of an SU(2) model of QCD based on the {\em ansatz} that the gauge-invariant gauge field is a hedgehog configuration, we show how the infinite series that represents the nonlocal interaction between quark color-charge densities can be evaluated nonperturbatively, without expanding it term-by-term. We discuss the implications of this model for QCD with SU(3) color and a gauge-invariant gauge field determined by QCD dynamics. '
9803251;'Spinors and the AdS/CFT correspondence';'Mans Henningson and Konstadinos Sfetsos';'Mon, 30 Mar 1998 20:41:17 GMT   (8kb)';'   We consider a free massive spinor field in Euclidean Anti-de Sitter space. The usual Dirac action in bulk is supplemented by a certain boundary term. The boundary conditions of the field are parametrized by a spinor on the boundary, subject to a projection. We calculate the dependence of the partition function on this boundary spinor. The result agrees with the generating functional of the correlation functions of a quasi-primary spinor operator, of a certain scaling dimension, in a free conformal field theory on the boundary. '
9803252;''t Hooft Vortices on D-branes';'Miao Li';'Mon, 30 Mar 1998 22:32:57 GMT   (15kb)';'   The point where a D2-brane intersecting a stack of D2-branes is proposed as a candidate for the 't Hooft vortex in the world-volume theory of N D2-branes. This straightforwardly generalizes to D3-branes, where a vortex line is generated by the intersection. Similarly, there are such objects on M-branes. We use Maldacena's conjecture to compute the static potential between a vortex and an anti-vortex in each case, in the large N limit. '

Debergh';'Tue, 31 Mar 1998 06:39:44 GMT   (15kb)';'   We study realizations of polynomial deformations of the sl(2,R)- Lie algebra in terms of differential operators strongly related to bosonic operators. We also distinguish their finite- and infinite-dimensional representations. The linear, quadratic and cubic cases are explicitly visited but the method works for arbitrary degrees in the polynomial functions. Multi-boson Hamiltonians are studied in the context of these ``nonlinear'' Lie algebras and some examples dealing with quantum optics are pointed out. '
9803254;'Confluences of Anomaly Freedom Requirements in M-theory';'Michael Faux';'Tue, 31 Mar 1998 19:22:44 GMT   (17kb)';'   A topological fact about eleven dimensions is used to motivate a potential new duality in M-theory. We complete the discussion of consistent limits of M-theory raised in a previous paper to include gravitational anomaly cancelation and four-form flux quantization in the context of the $M^{10}\times S^1/Z_2$ compactifications. A suprise is found: If one includes a $Z_2$ anomaly which exists only in 8k+3 dimensions then there are two distinct quantum limits, one related to each of two equivalency classes of the orbifolds $M^{10}\times S^1/Z_2$.

9803256;'On the value of coupling constant';'P.Pronin and K.Stepanyantz';'Tue, 31 Mar 1998 10:22:27 GMT   (8kb)';'   Using an analogy between Bogomol'nyi bound and the harmonic oscillator in quantum mechanics we propose a possible explanation of the coupling constant numerical value at the grand unification scale.

9803257;'2D Extremal Black Holes as Solitons';'M. Cadoni';'Tue, 31 Mar 1998 13:51:23 GMT   (13kb)';'   We discuss the relationship between two-dimensional (2D) dilaton gravity models and sine-Gordon-like field theories. We show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the solutions of 2D dilaton gravity and the solutions of a (two fields) generalization of the sine-Gordon model. In particular, we find a connection between the soliton solutions of the generalized sine-Gordon model and extremal black hole solutions of 2D dilaton gravity. As a by-product of our calculations we find a easy way to generate cosmological solutions of 2D dilaton gravity. '
9803258;'The non-abelian BFFT formalism for the collective coordinates';'Wilson Oliveira and Jorge Ananias Neto';'Tue, 31 Mar 1998 14:38:54 GMT   (12kb)';'   The collective coordinates expansion of the Skyrme soliton particle model gives rise to the second class constraints. We use the non-abelian BFFT formalism to convert this system into the one with only first class constraints. Choosing two different structure functions of the non-abelian algebra, we obtain simplified algebraic expressions for the first class non-abelian Hamiltonians. This result shows that the non-abelian BFFT method is, in many aspects, richer than the abelian BFFT formalism. For both of the first class Hamiltonians, we derive the Lagrangians which lead to the new theory. When one puts the extended phase space variables equal to zero, the original Skyrmion Lagrangian is reproduced. The method of the Dirac first class constraints is employed to quantize these two systems. We achieve the same spectrum, a result which confirms the consistency of the non-abelian BFFT formalism. '
9803259;'Euclidean-signature Supergravities, Dualities and Instantons';'E. Cremmer, I.V. Lavrinenko, H. Lu, C.N. Pope, K.S. Stelle and T.A.';'Tue, 31 Mar 1998 17:35:22 GMT   (43kb)';'   We study the Euclidean-signature supergravities that arise by compactifying D=11 supergravity or type IIB supergravity on a torus that includes the time direction. We show that the usual T-duality relation between type IIA and type IIB supergravities compactified on a spatial circle no longer holds if the reduction is performed on the time direction. Thus there are two inequivalent Euclidean-signature nine-dimensional maximal supergravities. They become equivalent upon further spatial compactification to D=8. We also show that duality symmetries of Euclidean-signature supergravities allow the harmonic functions of any single-charge or multi-charge instanton to be rescaled and shifted by constant factors. Combined with the usual diagonal dimensional reduction and oxidation procedures, this allows us to use the duality symmetries to map any single-charge or multi-charge p-brane soliton, or any intersection, into its near-horizon regime. Similar transformations can also be made on non-extremal p-branes. We also study the structures of duality multiplets of instanton and (D-3)-brane solutions. '
9803260;'Branes at angles and calibrated geometry';'BS Acharya, JM Figueroa-O'Farrill and B Spence';'Tue, 31 Mar 1998 18:00:59 GMT   (17kb)';'   In a recent paper, Ohta and Townsend studied the conditions which must be satisfied for a configuration of two intersecting M5-branes at angles to be supersymmetric. In this paper we extend this result to any number of M5-branes or any number of M2-branes. This is accomplished by interpreting their results in terms of calibrated geometry, which is of independent interest. '
9803261;'Thermodynamic Curvature of the BTZ Black Hole';'Rong-Gen Cai, Jin-Ho Cho';'Tue, 31 Mar 1998 20:13:10 GMT   (19kb)';'   Some thermodynamic properties of the Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole are studied to get the effective dimension of its corresponding statistical model. For this purpose, we make use of the geometrical approach to the thermodynamics: Considering the black hole as a thermodynamic system with two thermodynamic variables (the mass $M$ and the angular momemtum $J$), we obtain two-dimensional Riemannian thermodynamic geometry described by positive definite Ruppeiner metric. From the thermodynamic curvature we find that the extremal limit is the critical point. The effective spatial dimension of the statistical system corresponding to the near-extremal BTZ black holes is one. Far from the extremal point, the effective dimension becomes less than one, which leads to one possible speculation on the underlying structure for the corresponding statistical model. '
9803262;'Toward the M(F)--Theory Embedding of Realistic Free-Fermion Models';'Per Berglund, John Ellis, Alon E. Faraggi, D.V. Nanopoulos and Zongan';'Tue, 31 Mar 1998 20:15:54 GMT   (16kb)';'   We construct a Landau-Ginzburg model with the same data and symmetries as a $Z_2\times Z_2$ orbifold that corresponds to a class of realistic free-fermion models. Within the class of interest, we show that this orbifolding connects between different $Z_2\times Z_2$ orbifold models and commutes with the mirror symmetry. Our work suggests that duality symmetries previously discussed in the context of specific $M$ and $F$ theory compactifications may be extended to the special $Z_2\times Z_2$ orbifold that characterizes realistic free-fermion models.

9803263;'Wilson Loops, Confinement, and Phase Transitions in Large N Gauge';'Andreas Brandhuber, Nissan Itzhaki, Jacob Sonnenschein, Shimon';'Tue, 31 Mar 1998 20:31:18 GMT   (16kb)';'   We use the recently proposed supergravity approach to large $N$ gauge theories to calculate ordinary and spatial Wilson loops of gauge theories in various dimensions. In this framework we observe an area law for spatial Wilson loops in four and five dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills at finite temperature. This can be interpreted as the area law of ordinary Wilson loops in three and four dimensional non-supersymmetric gauge theories at zero temperature which indicates confinement in these theories. Furthermore, we show that super Yang Mills theories with 16 supersymmetries at finite temperature do not admit phase transitions between the weakly coupled super Yang Mills and supergravity regimes. This result is derived by analyzing the entropy and specific heat of those systems as well as by computing ordinary Wilson loops at finite temperature. The calculation of the entropy was carried out in all different regimes and indicates that there is no first order phase transition in these systems. For the same theories at zero temperature we also compute the dependence of the quark anti-quark potential on the separating distance. '
9803264;'Critical exponents for 3D O(n)-symmetric model with n > 3';'S. A. Antonenko and A. I. Sokolov (Saint Petersburg Electrotechnical';'Tue, 31 Mar 1998 20:47:31 GMT   (8kb)';'   Critical exponents for the 3D O(n)-symmetric model with n > 3 are estimated on the base of six-loop renormalization-group (RG) expansions. A simple Pade-Borel technique is used for the resummation of the RG series and the Pade approximants [L/1] are shown to give rather good numerical results for all calculated quantities. For large n, the fixed point location g_c and the critical exponents are also determined directly from six-loop expansions without addressing the resummation procedure. An analysis of the numbers obtained shows that resummation becomes unnecessary when n exceeds 28 provided an accuracy of about 0.01 is adopted as satisfactory for g_c and critical exponents. Further, results of the calculations performed are used to estimate the numerical accuracy of the 1/n-expansion. The same value n = 28 is shown to play the role of the lower boundary of the domain where this approximation provides high-precision estimates for the critical exponents. '

9804201;'On the (0,4) Conformal Field Theory of the Throat';'Clifford V. Johnson';'Thu, 30 Apr 1998 04:40:32 GMT   (20kb)';'   In SO(32) heterotic string theory, the space-time at the core of N coincident NS-fivebranes is an infinite throat, R x S^3. As shown by Witten, the throat signals a singularity in the usual heterotic string conformal field theory and a non--perturbative USp(2N) gauge group appears, due to the N small instantons at the fivebranes' core. Nevertheless, we look for some trace of the non-perturbative physics in a description of the heterotic string infinitely far down the throat. Our guide is a D1-brane probing N D5-branes in type I, which yields a 1+1 dimensional (0,4) supersymmetric model with ADHM data in its couplings, as shown by Douglas. The neighbourhood of the classical boundary of the hypermultiplet moduli space of the theory flows to an exact conformal field theory description of the throat theory. Ironically, the remnant of the non-perturbative symmetry is indeed found in the conformal field theory, lurking in the structure of the partition function, and encoded in a family of deformations of the theory along flat directions. The deformations have an explicit description using the flow from the type I theory, and have a hyperKahler structure. Similar results hold true for the analogous (4,4) supersymmetric situation in the type IIB theory, as is evident in the work of Diaconescu and Seiberg. '
9804202;'The Spacetime Superalgebras from M-branes in M-brane Backgrounds';'Takeshi Sato';'Thu, 30 Apr 1998 07:32:42 GMT   (13kb)';'   We derive the spacetime superalgebras explicitly from ``test'' M-brane actions in M-brane backgrounds to the lowest order in $\theta$ via canonical formalism, and discuss various BPS saturated configurations on the basis of their central charges which depend on the harmonic functions determined by the backgrounds. All the 1/4 supersymmetric intersections of two M-branes obtained previously are deduced from the requirement of the test branes to be so ``gauge fixed'' in the brane backgrounds as to preserve 1/4 supersymmetry. Furthermore, some of 1/2-supersymmetric bound states of two M-branes are deduced from the behavior of the harmonic functions in the limits of vanishing distances of the two branes. The possibilities of some triple intersections preserving 1/4 supersymmetry are also discussed. '
9804203;'Linear Stability of Dilatonic Black Holes';'Panagiota Kanti (University of Ioannina)';'Thu, 30 Apr 1998 14:49:35 GMT   (29kb)';'   In this talk, we recall the most important features of the Dilatonic Black Holes which arise in the framework of the Einstein-Dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet theory and which are dressed with a classical long range dilaton field in contradiction with the existing "no-hair" theorems of the Theory of General Relativity. We demonstrate linear stability of these black hole solutions under small spacetime-dependent perturbations by making use of a semi-analytic method based on the Fubini-Sturm's theorem. As a result, the Dilatonic Black Holes constitute one of the very few examples of stable black hole solutions with non-trivial "hair" that arise in the framework of a more generalised theory of gravity.

Varela';'Thu, 30 Apr 1998 16:27:45 GMT   (31kb)';'   We derive Bogomolny equations for an Einstein-Yang-Mills-dilaton-$\sigma$ model (EYMD-$\sigma$) on a static spacetime, showing that the Einstein equations are satisfied if and only if the associated (conformally scaled) three-metric is flat. These are precisely the static metrics for which super-covariantly constant spinors exist. We study some general properties of these equations and then consider the problem of obtaining axially symmetric solutions for the gauge group SU(2). '
9804205;'Bosonized Massive N-flavor Schwinger Model';'Yutaka Hosotani and Ramon Rodriguez';'Thu, 30 Apr 1998 16:30:09 GMT   (49kb)';'   The massive N-flavor Schwinger model is analyzed by the bosonization method. The problem is reduced to the quantum mechanics of N degrees of freedom in which the potential needs to be self-consistently determined by its ground-state wave function and spectrum with given values of the $\theta$ parameter, fermion masses, and temperature. Boson masses and fermion chiral condensates are evaluated. In the N=1 model the anomalous behavior is found at $\theta \sim \pi$ and $m/\mu \sim 0.4$. In the N=3 model an asymmetry in fermion masses $(m_1 < m_2 \ll m_3)$ removes the singularity at $\theta=\pi$ and T=0. The chiral condensates at $\theta=0$ are insensitive to the asymmetry in fermion masses, but are significantly sensitive at $\theta=\pi$. The resultant picture is similar to that obtained in QCD by the chiral Lagrangian method. '

The theory is defined through a large $N$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model in a nontrivial background and in a particular double scaling limit. We examine the canonical structure of the theory and describe an infinite-dimensional Poisson algebra of currents. '
9804207;'An Improved Gaussian Approximation for Quantum Field Theory';'Antun Balaz, Aleksandar Belic and Aleksandar Bogojevic (Institute of';'Thu, 30 Apr 1998 17:31:03 GMT   (58kb)';'   We present a new approximation technique for quantum field theory. The standard one-loop result is used as a seed for a recursive formula that gives a sequence of improved Gaussian approximations for the generating functional. In a different setting, the basic idea of this recursive scheme is used in the second part of the paper to substantialy speed up the standard Monte Carlo algorithm. '
9804208;'Lectures on Orientifolds and Duality';'Atish Dabholkar';'Thu, 30 Apr 1998 17:36:23 GMT   (70kb)';'   This is an introduction to orientifolds with emphasis on applications to duality. Based on lectures given at the 1997 Trieste Summer School on Particle Physics and Cosmology, Italy. '
9804209;'Einstein spaces in five and seven dimensions and non-supersymmetric';'J.G. Russo';'Thu, 30 Apr 1998 18:24:18 GMT   (9kb)';'   A one-parameter family of new solutions representing Einstein spaces in $d=5,7$ is presented, and used to construct non-supersymmetric backgrounds in type IIB and M-theory that asymptotically approach $AdS_5\times S^5$ and $AdS_7\times S^4$ . Upon dimensional reduction, the latter gives a type IIA solution representing a 4-brane with Ramond-Ramond charge, which interpolates between the "near-horizon" non-extremal D4 brane and a geometry connected by T-duality to a new constant dilaton solution in type IIB. We discuss the possibility that M-theory on this space may be related to a (0,2) six-dimensional field theory on $S^1\times S^1$, with fermions obeying antiperiodic boundary conditions in both circles. '
9804210;'String Junctions for Arbitrary Lie Algebra Representations';'Oliver DeWolfe and Barton Zwiebach';'Thu, 30 Apr 1998 20:01:41 GMT   (385kb)';'   We consider string junctions with endpoints on a set of branes of IIB string theory defining an ADE-type gauge Lie algebra. We show how to characterize uniquely equivalence classes of junctions related by string/brane crossing through invariant charges that count the effective number of prongs ending on each brane. Each equivalence class defines a point on a lattice of junctions. We define a metric on this lattice arising from the intersection pairing of junctions, and use self-intersection to identify junctions in the adjoint and fundamental representations of all ADE algebras. This information suffices to determine the relation between junction lattices and the Lie-algebra weight lattices. Arbitrary representations are built by allowing junctions with asymptotic (p,q) charges, on which the group of conjugacy classes of representations is represented additively. One can view the (p,q) asymptotic charges as Dynkin labels associated to two new fundamental weight vectors. '
9805201;'New Instanton Solutions at Finite Temperature';'Thomas C. Kraan and Pierre van Baal';'Thu, 28 May 1998 14:12:14 GMT   (80kb)';'   We discuss the newly found exact instanton solutions at finite temperature with a non-trivial Polyakov loop at infinity. They can be described in terms of monopole constituents and we discuss in this context an old result due to Taubes how to make out of monopoles non-trivial topological charge configurations, with possible applications to abelian projection.

9805202;'Bound states and brane annihilation in 11 $D$ SUGRA';'Aleksey Nudelman';'Fri, 29 May 1998 00:29:18 GMT   (12kb)';'   We study scattering of $D0$ branes in eleven dimensional supergravity (SUGRA) using the tree level four point amplitude. The range of validity of SUGRA allows us to make reliable calculations of relativistic brane scattering, inaccessible in string theory because of halo effects. We also compare the rate of annihilation of $D0-\bar{D0}$ branes to the rate of elastic $D0-\bar{D0}$ scattering and find that the former is always smaller than the latter. We also find a pole in $\sigma_{D0-\bar{D0}}$. We exploit the analogy with the positronium to argue that the brane anti-brane pairs form branium atoms in 3 spatial dimensions. We also derive a long range effective potential for interacting branes which explicitly depends on their polarizations. We compare two approaches to large impact parameter brane scattering: in GR, polarizations of the branes are kept constant during the interaction, while in QFT, one sums over all possible polarizations. We show that the GR and QFT approaches give the same answer. '

Baaquie';'Thu, 28 May 1998 17:46:15 GMT   (13kb)';'   Lagrangians for gauge fields and matter fields can be constructed from the infinite dimensional Kac-Moody algebra and group. A continuum regularization is used to obtain such generic lagrangians, which contain new nonlinear and asymmetric interactions not present in gauge theories based on compact Lie groups. This technique is applied to deriving the Yang-Mills and Chern-Simons lagrangians for the Kac-Moody case. The extension of this method to D=4, N=(1/2,0) supersymmetric Kac-Moody gauge fields is also made. '

Barcelos-Neto and Ashok Das';'Thu, 28 May 1998 19:40:32 GMT   (7kb)';'   We study the 0+1 dimensional Chern-Simons theory at finite temperature within the framework of derivative expansion. We obtain various interesting relations, solve the theory within this framework and argue that the derivative expansion is not a suitable formalism for a study of the question of large gauge invariance.

9805205;'D=11 Supergravity Revisited';'S. Deser (Brandeis University)';'Thu, 28 May 1998 20:39:24 GMT   (11kb)';'   I discuss two novel results in D=11 Supergravity. The first establishes, in two complementary ways, a no-go theorem that, in contrast to all D<11, a cosmological extension of the theory does not exist. The second deals with the structure of (on-shell) four-point invariants. These are important both for establishing existence of the lowest (2-loop) order candidate counter-terms in the theory proper, as well as for comparison with the form of eventual "zero-slope" QFT limit of M-theory.

9805206;'Non-Simply-Connected Gauge Groups and Rational Points on Elliptic Curves';'Paul S. Aspinwall and David R. Morrison';'Thu, 28 May 1998 21:45:49 GMT   (17kb)';'   We consider the F-theory description of non-simply-connected gauge groups appearing in the E8 x E8 heterotic string. The analysis is closely tied to the arithmetic of torsion points on an elliptic curve. The general form of the corresponding elliptic fibration is given for all finite subgroups of E8 which are applicable in this context. We also study the closely-related question of point-like instantons on a K3 surface whose holonomy is a finite group. As an example we consider the case of the heterotic string on a K3 surface having the E8 gauge symmetry broken to (E6 x SU(3))/Z3 or SU(9)/Z3 by point-like instantons with Z3 holonomy. '
9805207;'A New Approach to String Cosmology';'Gary T. Horowitz and Donald Marolf';'Thu, 28 May 1998 22:12:08 GMT   (20kb)';'   We discuss quotients of Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime by a discrete group in light of the AdS-CFT correspondence. Some quotients describe closed universes which expand from zero volume to a maximum size and then contract. Maldacena's conjecture suggests that they should be represented in string theory by suitable quotients of the boundary conformal field theory. We discuss the required identifications, and construct the states associated with the linearized supergravity modes in the cosmological background. '
9805208;'The Perturbation Spectrum of Black Holes in N=8 Supergravity';'Finn Larsen';'Thu, 28 May 1998 22:47:19 GMT   (19kb)';'   The near horizon geometry of four-dimensional black holes in the dilute gas regime is AdS_3 x S^2, and the global symmetry group is SU(2) x USp(6). This is exploited to calculate their perturbation spectrum using group theoretical methods. The result is interpreted in terms of three extreme M5-branes, orthogonally intersecting over a common string. We also consider N=8 black holes in five dimensions, and compute the spectrum by explicit decoupling of the equations of motion, extending recent work on N=4 black holes. This result is interpreted in terms of D1- and D5-branes that are wrapped on a small four-torus. The spectra are compared with string theory. '
9805209;'The Spacetime Superalgebras in a Massive IIA Background via Brane Probes';'Takeshi Sato';'Fri, 29 May 1998 08:43:46 GMT   (13kb)';'   We derive the spacetime superalgebras explicitly from ``test'' p-brane actions in a D-8-brane (i.e. a massive IIA) background to the lowest order in $\theta$ via canonical formalism, and show that the forms of the superalgebras are the same as those in all the other D-brane (i.e. massless IIA) backgrounds, that is, they are indifferent to the presence of the Chern-Simons terms which are proportional to the mass and added to the D-brane actions in the case of massive IIA backgrounds. Thus, we can say that all the D-brane background solutions including a D-8-brane are on equal footing from the viewpoint of the superalgebras via brane probes. We also deduce from the algebra all the previously known 1/4 supersymmetric intersections of a p-brane or a fundamental string with a D-8-brane, as the supersymmetric ``gauge fixings'' of the test branes in the D-8-brane background.

9805210;'The Wilson Renormalization Group Approach of the Principal Chiral Model';'B. Delamotte, D. Mouhanna, P. Lecheminant';'Fri, 29 May 1998 15:26:57 GMT   (9kb)';'   We study the Principal Chiral Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson model around two dimensions within the Local Potential Approximation of an Exact Renormalization Group equation. This model, relevant for the long distance physics of classical frustrated spin systems, exhibits a fixed point of the same universality class that the corresponding Non-Linear Sigma model. This allows to shed light on the long-standing discrepancy between the different perturbative approaches of frustrated spin systems. '
9805211;'T-Duality in Lattice Regularized Sigma Models';'Sebastian Jaimungal (N. B. I. and British Columbia U.)';'Fri, 29 May 1998 18:43:11 GMT   (12kb)';'   It is shown that when the underlying sigma model of bosonic string theory is written in terms of single-valued fields, which live in the covering space of the target space, Abelian T-duality survives lattice regularization of the world-sheet. The projection onto the target-space is implemented through a sum over cohomology, which bears resemblance to summing over topological sectors in Yang-Mills theories. In particular, the case of string theory on a circle is shown to be explicitly self-dual in the lattice regulated model and automatically forbids vortex excitations which would otherwise destroy the duality. For other target spaces a generalized notion of T-duality is observed in which the target space and the cohomology coefficient group are interchanged under duality. Specific examples show that the fundamental group of the target space may not be preserved in the T-dual theory. Generalized models which exhibit T-duality behaviour, with dynamical variables that live on the k-dimensional cells of (p+1)-dimensional world-volumes, are also constructed. These models correspond to gauge theories, and higher-dimensional analogues, in which one sums over various topological sectors of the theory. '

With the proper normalization, using Virasoro constraints, we prove the equivalence of this model and the Kontsevich matrix model for $\eta\ne0$ and find the explicit transformation between the two models.

Nelson';'Fri, 29 May 1998 15:07:44 GMT   (8kb)';'   The structure of the state-vector space for the two-mode parabose system is investigated and a complete set of state-vectors is constructed. The basis vectors are orthonormal in order $p=2$. In order $p=2$, conserved-charge parabose coherent states are constructed and an explicit completeness relation is obtained. '
9805215;'The Complete Solution of the Classical SL(2,R)/U(1) Gauged WZNW Field';'Uwe Mueller, Gerhard Weigt';'Fri, 29 May 1998 15:29:24 GMT   (14kb)';'   We prove that any gauged WZNW model has a Lax pair representation, and give explicitly the general solution of the classical equations of motion of the SL(2,R)/U(1) theory. We calculate the symplectic structure of this solution by solving a differential equation of the Gelfand-Dikii type with initial state conditions at infinity, and transform the canonical physical fields non-locally onto canonical free fields. The results will, finally, be collected in a local B\"acklund transformation. These calculations prepare the theory for an exact canonical quantization. '

This supergeometry can be used for the construction of new superconformal theories. We also discuss the Green-Schwarz action for a type IIB string on adS_5 x S_5. '
9805218;'Duality of Non-Supersymmetric Large N Gauge Theories';'Martin Schmaltz (Boston University)';'Fri, 29 May 1998 19:17:50 GMT   (32kb)';'   Starting from Seiberg's electric-magnetic duality for supersymmetric QCD, we construct dual pairs of non-supersymmetric gauge theories. This is accomplished by first taking the large N limit of supersymmetric QCD and its dual partner and then performing a special ``orbifold projection'' recently introduced by Kachru and Silverstein. We argue that in the large N limit the two projected theories remain dual. The non-supersymmetric gauge theories which can be studied in this fashion have non-supersymmetric field content, chiral fermions and exactly massless scalar matter. '
9805219;'The Mass Operator in the Light-Cone Representation';'Gary McCartor (SMU)';'Fri, 29 May 1998 20:26:28 GMT   (7kb)';'   I argue that for the case of fermions with nonzero bare mass there is a term in the matter density operator in the light-cone representation which has been omitted from previous calculations. The new term provides agreement with previous results in the equal-time representation for mass perturbation theory in the massive Schwinger model. For the DLCQ case the physics of the new term can be represented by an effective operator which acts in the DLCQ subspace, but the form of the term might be hard to guess and I do not know how to determine its coefficient from symmetry considerations.

9805220;'Constraints on the BPS Spectrum of N = 2, D = 4 Theories with A-D-E';'Oliver DeWolfe, Tamas Hauer, Amer Iqbal and Barton Zwiebach';'Fri, 29 May 1998 23:43:30 GMT   (23kb)';'   BPS states of N=2, D=4 Super Yang-Mills theories with ADE flavor symmetry arise as junctions joining a D3-brane to a set of 7-branes defining the enhanced flavor algebra. We show that the familiar BPS spectrum of SU(2) theories with N_f <= 4 is simply given by the set of junctions whose self-intersection is bounded below as required by supersymmetry. This constraint, together with the relations between junction and weight lattices, is used to establish the appearance of arbitrarily large flavor representations for the case of D_{n>=5} and E_n symmetries. Such representations are required by consistency with decoupling down to smaller flavor symmetries. '
9806201;'Feynman Graphs from D-Particle Dynamics';'Amir H. Fatollahi';'Wed, 24 Jun 1998 13:11:34 GMT   (8kb)';'   It is argued that quantum propagation of D-particles in the limit \alpha'-> 0 can represent the "joining-splitting" processes of Feynman graphs of a certain field theory in the light-cone frame. So basically it provides the possibility to define a field theory by its Feynman graphs. The application of this observation to define M-theory by an energetic expansion approach is discussed. '
9806202;'Comment about UV regularization of basic commutators in string theories';'A.Yu. Kamenshchik, I.M. Khalatnikov (Landau Institute for Theoretical';'Wed, 24 Jun 1998 15:43:09 GMT   (6kb)';'   Recently proposed by Hwang, Marnelius and Saltsidis zeta regularization of basic commutators in string theories is generalized to the string models with non-trivial vacuums. It is shown that implementation of this regularization implies the cancellation of dangerous terms in the commutators between Virasoro generators, which break Jacobi identity. '
9806203;'Black hole lasers';'S. Corley and T. Jacobson';'Wed, 24 Jun 1998 17:57:12 GMT   (23kb)';'   High frequency dispersion does not alter the low frequency spectrum of Hawking radiation from a single black hole horizon, whether the dispersion entails subluminal or superluminal group velocities. We show here that in the presence of an inner horizon as well as an outer horizon the superluminal case differs dramatically however. The negative energy partners of Hawking quanta return to the outer horizon and stimulate more Hawking radiation if the field is bosonic or suppress it if the field is fermionic. This process leads to exponential growth or damping of the radiated flux and correlations among the quanta emitted at different times, unlike in the usual Hawking effect. These phenomena may be observable in condensed matter black hole analogs that exhibit "superluminal" dispersion. '
9806204;'The Spectrum of Softly Broken N=1 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory';'G.R. Farrar, G. Gabadadze and M. Schwetz (Rutgers Univ.)';'Wed, 24 Jun 1998 18:07:24 GMT   (17kb)';'   We study the spectrum of the softly broken generalized Veneziano-Yankielowicz effective action for N=1 SUSY Yang-Mills theory. Two dual formulations of the effective action are given. The spurion method is used for the soft SUSY breaking. Masses of the bound states are calculated and mixing patterns are discussed. Mass splittings of pure gluonic states are consistent with predictions of conventional Yang-Mills theory. The results can be tested in lattice simulations of the SUSY Yang-Mills model. '

'
9806206;'Renormalisation of gravitational self interaction for wiggly strings';'Brandon Carter';'Wed, 24 Jun 1998 20:01:00 GMT   (9kb)';'   It is shown that for any elastic string model with energy density $U$ and tension $T$, the divergent contribution from gravitational self interaction can be allowed for by an action renormalisation proportional to $(U-T)^2$. This formula is applied to the important special case of a bare model of the transonic type (characterised by a constant value of the product $UT$) that represents the macroscopically averaged effect of shortwavelength wiggles on an underlying microscopic model of the Nambu-Goto type (characterised by $U=T$).

The structure of the general solution is established, and the characteristic arbitrariness in generating functions is described. '
9806208;'Chiral Symmetry Breaking in an External Field';'C. N. Leung (U. of Delaware)';'Thu, 25 Jun 1998 14:07:46 GMT   (9kb)';'   The effects of an external field on the dynamics of chiral symmetry breaking are studied using quenched, ladder QED as our model gauge field theory. It is found that a uniform external magnetic field enables the chiral symmetry to be spontaneously broken at weak gauge couplings, in contrast with the situation when no external field is present. The broken chiral symmetry is restored at high temperatures as well as at high chemical potentials. The nature of the two chiral phase transitions is different: the transition at high temperatures is a continuous one whereas the phase transition at high chemical potentials is discontinuous. '
9806209;'Open rigid string with the Gauss-Bonnet term in action';'V. V. Nesterenko and I. G. Pirozhenko';'Thu, 25 Jun 1998 15:15:43 GMT   (44kb)';'   The effect of the Gaussian curvature in the rigid string action on the interquark potential is investigated. The linearized equations of motion and boundary conditions, following from the modified string action, are obtained. The equation, defining the eigenfrequency spectrum of the string oscillations is derived. On this basis, the interquark potential, generated by the string is calculated in one-loop approximation. A substantial influence of the topological term in the string action on the interquark potential at the distances of hadronic size order or less is revealed. '
9806210;'Theta vacuum in different gauges';'Christoph Adam';'Thu, 25 Jun 1998 18:13:03 GMT   (11kb)';'   In some recent papers it is claimed that the physical significance of the vacuum angle theta for QCD-like theories depends on the chosen gauge condition. We criticise the arguments that were given in support of this claim, and show by explicit construction for the case of QED$_2$ that and why they fail, confirming thereby the commonly accepted point of view. '
9806211;'Normalization of the chiral condensate in the massive Schwinger model';'Christoph Adam';'Thu, 25 Jun 1998 18:16:11 GMT   (12kb)';'   Within mass perturbation theory, already the first order contribution to the chiral condensate of the massive Schwinger model is UV divergent. We discuss the problem of choosing a proper normalization and, by making use of some bosonization results, we are able to choose a normalization so that the resulting chiral condensate may be compared, e.g., with lattice data. '
9806212;'Renormal-order improvement of the Schwinger mass';'Christoph Adam';'Thu, 25 Jun 1998 18:28:33 GMT   (17kb)';'   The massive Schwinger model may be analysed by a perturbation expansion in the fermion mass. However, the results of this mass perturbation theory are sensible only for sufficiently small fermion mass. By performing a renormal-ordering, we arrive at a chiral perturbation expansion where the expansion parameter remains small even for large fermion mass. We use this renormal-ordered chiral perturbation theory for a computation of the Schwinger mass and compare our results with lattice computations. '
9806213;'Potential analysis and absorption cross section in the D1-D5 brane';'H.W. Lee and Y.S. Myung (Inje University)';'Fri, 26 Jun 1998 03:42:21 GMT   (16kb)';'   We analyze the potentials which arise from the D1--D5 brane (5D black hole). In the sufficiently low energy ($\omega \ll 1$), we can derive the Schrodinger-type equation with potential $V_N$ from the linearized equations. In this case one can understand the difference between absorption cross section for a free and two fixed scalars intuitively in terms of their potentials. In the low temperature limit ($\omega \gg T_H$), one expects the logarithmic correction to the cross section of a free scalar. However, we cannot obtain the Schrodinger equation with potential for this case. Finally we comment on the stability of 5D black hole. '
9806214;'Tachyons and Black Hole Horizons in Gauge Theory';'Daniel Kabat (Institute for Advanced Study) and Gilad Lifschytz';'Fri, 26 Jun 1998 18:24:02 GMT   (21kb)';'   Any probe which crosses the horizon of a black hole should be absorbed. In M(atrix) theory, for 0-brane probes of Schwarzschild black holes, we argue that the relevant absorption mechanism is a tachyon instability which sets in at the horizon. We give qualitative arguments, and some quantitative large-N calculations, in support of this claim. The tachyon instability provides an attractive mechanism for infalling matter to be captured and thermalized by a Schwarzschild black hole. '
9806215;'Brans-Dicke theory with the cosmological constant from M_4 x Z_2';'Kunihiko Uehara';'Fri, 26 Jun 1998 08:54:33 GMT   (8kb)';'   The theory on M_4 x Z_2 geometry is applied to the Einstein gravity to yield the Brans-Dicke theory on M_4 geometry. The geometrical meaning and the relation between the curvatures and the torsions are clarified. The cosmological constant is also introduced into the pure Einstein action on M_4 x Z_2 in order to determine the explicit form of the cosmological term in the Brans-Dicke theory on M_4 geometry. '
9806216;'On the origin of supergravity boundary terms in the AdS/CFT';'G.E.Arutyunov and S.A.Frolov';'Fri, 26 Jun 1998 09:13:43 GMT   (12kb)';'   The standard formulation of the AdS/CFT correspondence is incomplete since it requires adding to a supergravity action some a priori unknown boundary terms. We suggest a modification of the correspondence principle based on the Hamiltonian formulation of the supergravity action, which does not require any boundary terms. Then all the boundary terms of the standard formulation naturally appear by passing from the Hamiltonian version to the Lagrangian one. As examples the graviton part of the supergravity action on the product of $AdS_{d+1}$ with a compact Einstein manifold $\cal E$ and fermions on $AdS_{d+1}$ are considered. We also discuss conformal transformations of gravity fields on the boundary of $AdS$ and show that they are induced by the isometries of $AdS$. '
9806217;'A remark on the AdS/CFT correspondence and the renormalization group';'E.T.Akhmedov (ITEP)';'Fri, 26 Jun 1998 10:45:21 GMT   (9kb)';'   The correspondence between the four-dimensional SU(N), $\cN = 4$ SYM taken at large $N$ and the type II B SUGRA on the $AdS_5\times S_5$ background is considered. We argue that the classical equations of motion in the SUGRA picture can be interpreted as that of the renormalization group on the SYM side. In fact, when the D3-brane is slightly excited higher derivative terms in the field theory on its world-volume deform it form the conformal $\cN = 4$ SYM limit. We give arguments in favor of that the deformation goes in the way set by the SUGRA equations of motion. Concrete example of the s-wave dilaton is considered. '

9806220;'Dynamical Lorentz simmetry breaking from 3+1 Axion-Wess-Zumino model';'A. A. Andrianov, R. Soldati, L. Sorbo';'Sat, 27 Jun 1998 09:48:21 GMT   (21kb)';'   We study the renormalizable abelian vector-field models in the presence of the Wess-Zumino interaction with the pseudoscalar matter. The renormalizability is achieved by supplementing the standard kinetic term of vector fields with higher derivatives. The appearance of fourth power of momentum in the vector-field propagator leads to the super-renormalizable theory in which the $\beta$-function, the vector-field renormalization constant and the anomalous mass dimension are calculated exactly. It is shown that this model has the infrared stable fixed point and its low-energy limit is non-trivial. The modified effective potential for the pseudoscalar matter leads to the possible occurrence of dynamical breaking of the Lorentz symmetry. This phenomenon is related to the modification of Electrodynamics by means of the Chern-Simons (CS) interaction polarized along a constant CS vector. Its presence makes the vacuum optically active that has been recently estimated from astrophysical data. We examine two possibilities for the CS vector to be time-like or space-like, under the assumption that it originates from v.e.v. of some pseudoscalar matter and show that only the latter one is consistent in the framework of the AWZ model, because a time-like CS vector makes the vacuum unstable under pairs creation of tachyonic photon modes with the finite vacuum decay rate.

9806221;'Classical Aspects of the Abelian Higgs Model on the Light Front';'K. Itakura (YITP, Kyoto), S. Maedan (Tokyo Nat. Coll.) and M.';'Sat, 27 Jun 1998 10:45:14 GMT   (9kb)';'   We investigate canonical structure of the Abelian Higgs model within the framework of DLCQ. Careful boundary analysis of differential equations, such as the Euler-Lagrange equations, leads us to a novel situation where the canonical structure changes in a drastic manner depending on whether the (light-front) spatial Wilson line is periodic or not. In the former case, the gauge-field ZM takes discrete values and we obtain the so-called ``Zero-Mode Constraints'' (ZMCs), whose semiclassical solutions give a nonzero vev to the scalar fields. Contrary, in the latter case, we have no ZMC and the scalar ZMs remain dynamical as well as the gauge-field ZM. In order to give classically nonzero vev to the scalar field, we work in a background field which minimizes the light-front energy. '
9806222;'Reflection Factors for the Principal Chiral Model';'J.N. Prata';'Sat, 27 Jun 1998 12:54:05 GMT   (13kb)';'   We consider the SU(2) Principal Chiral Model (at level $k=1$) on the half-line with scale invariant boundary conditions. By looking at the IR limiting conformal field theory and comparing with the Kondo problem, we propose the set of permissible boundary conditions and the corresponding reflection factors. '
9806223;'Equivalence of Hawking and Unruh Temperatures and Entropies Through Flat';'S. Deser and Orit Levin';'Sat, 27 Jun 1998 22:45:43 GMT   (4kb)';'   We present a unified description of temperature and entropy in spaces with either "true" or "accelerated observer" horizons: In their (higher dimensional) global embedding Minkowski geometries, the relevant detectors have constant accelerations a_{G}; associated with their Rindler horizons are temperature a_{G}/2\pi and entropy equal to 1/4 the horizon area. Both quantities agree with those calculated in the original curved spaces.   As one example of this equivalence, we obtain the temperature and entropy of Schwarzschild geometry from its flat D=6 embedding. '
9806224;'M-Theory Five-brane Wrapped on Curves for Exceptional Groups';'Elena Caceres and Pirjo Pasanen';'Mon, 29 Jun 1998 02:49:13 GMT   (57kb)';'   We study the M-theory five-brane wrapped around the Seiberg-Witten curves for pure classical and exceptional groups given by an integrable system. Generically, the D4-branes arise as cuts that collapse to points after compactifying the eleventh dimension and going to the semiclassical limit, producing brane configurations of NS5- and D4-branes with N=2 gauge theories on the world volume of the four-branes. We study the symmetries of the different curves to see how orientifold planes are related to the involutions needed to obtain the distinguished Prym variety of the curve. This explains the subtleties encountered for the Sp(2n) and SO(2n +1). Using this approach we investigate the curves for exceptional groups, especially G_2 and E_6, and show that unlike for classical groups taking the semiclassical ten dimensional limit does not reduce the cuts to D4-branes. For G_2 we find a genus two quotient curve that contains the Prym and has the right properties to describe the G_2 field theory, but the involutions are far more complicated than the ones for classical groups. To realize them in M-theory instead of an orientifold plane we would need another object, a kind of curved orientifold surface. '
9806225;'Matrix Theory Description of Schwarzschild Black Holes in the Regime N';'S. Kalyana Rama';'Mon, 29 Jun 1998 04:57:53 GMT   (13kb)';'   We study the description of Schwarzschild black holes, of entropy S, within matrix theory in the regime $N \ge S \gg 1$. We obtain the most general matrix theory equation of state by requiring that black holes admit a description within this theory. It has a recognisable form in various cases. In some cases a D dimensional black hole can plausibly be thought of as a $\tilde{D} = D + 1$ dimensional black hole, described by another auxiliary matrix theory, but in its $\tilde{N} \sim S$ regime. We find what appears to be a matrix theory generalisation to higher dynamical branes of the normalisation of dynamical string tension, seen in other contexts. We discuss a further possible generalisation of the matrix theory equation of state. In a special case, it is governed by $N^3$ dynamical degrees of freedom. '
9806226;'On the M-theory Interpretation of Orientifold Planes';'Eric G. Gimon';'Mon, 29 Jun 1998 23:54:15 GMT   (21kb)';'   We obtain an M--theory interpretation of different IIA orientifold planes by compactifying them on a circle and use a chain of dualities to get a new IIA limit of these objects using this circle as the eleventh dimension. Using the combination of the two IIA description, we give an interpretation for all orientifold four-planes in M-theory, including a mechanism for freezing M5-branes at singularities. '
9806227;'One-Loop Pauli-Villars Regularization of Supergravity I: Canonical Gauge';'Mary K. Gaillard';'Mon, 29 Jun 1998 12:31:33 GMT   (31kb)';'   It is shown that the one-loop coefficients of on-shell operators of standard supergravity with canonical gauge kinetic energy can be regulated by the introduction of Pauli-Villars chiral and abelian gauge multiplets, subject to a condition on the matter representations of the gauge group. Aspects of the anomaly structure of these theories under global nonlinear symmetries and an anomalous gauge symmetry are discussed. '
9806228;'Projective Statistics and Spinors in Hilbert Space';'Frank Wilczek';'Mon, 29 Jun 1998 14:06:26 GMT   (4kb)';'   In quantum mechanics, symmetry groups can be realized by projective, as well as by ordinary unitary, representations. For the permutation symmetry relevant to quantum statistics of N indistinguishable particles, the simplest properly projective representation is highly non-trivial, of dimension $2^{(N-1)/2}$, and is most easily realized starting with spinor geometry. Quasiparticles in the Pfaffian quantum Hall state realize this representation. Projective statistics is a consistent theoretical possibility in any dimension. '
9806229;'From Super QCD to QCD';'Francesco Sannino (Yale University)';'Mon, 29 Jun 1998 14:41:33 GMT   (9kb)';'   We present a ``toy'' model for breaking supersymmetric gauge theories at the effective Lagrangian level. We show that it is possible to achieve the decoupling of gluinos and squarks, below a given supersymmetry breaking scale m, in the fundamental theory for super QCD once a suitable choice of supersymmetry breaking terms is made. A key feature of the model is the description of the ordinary QCD degrees of freedom via the auxiliary fields of the supersymmetric effective Lagrangian. Once the anomaly induced effective QCD meson potential is deduced we also suggest a decoupling procedure, when a flavored quark becomes massive, which mimics the one employed by Seiberg for supersymmetric theories. It is seen that, after quark decoupling, the QCD potential naturally converts to the one with one less flavor. Finally we investigate the N_c and N_f dependence of the \eta^{\prime} mass. '
9806230;'Pre-big bang bubbles from the gravitational instability of generic';'A. Buonanno, T. Damour and G. Veneziano';'Mon, 29 Jun 1998 15:49:36 GMT   (176kb)';'   We formulate the basic postulate of pre-big bang cosmology as one of ``asymptotic past triviality'', by which we mean that the initial state is a generic perturbative solution of the tree-level low-energy effective action. Such a past-trivial ``string vacuum'' is made of an arbitrary ensemble of incoming gravitational and dilatonic waves, and is generically prone to gravitational instability, leading to the possible formation of many black holes hiding singular space-like hypersurfaces. Each such singular space-like hypersurface of gravitational collapse becomes, in the string-frame metric, the usual big-bang t=0 hypersurface, i.e. the place of birth of a baby Friedmann universe after a period of dilaton-driven inflation. Specializing to the spherically-symmetric case, we review and reinterpret previous work on the subject, and propose a simple, scale-invariant criterion for collapse/inflation in terms of asymptotic data at past null infinity. Those data should determine whether, when, and where collapse/inflation occurs, and, when it does, fix its characteristics, including anisotropies on the big bang hypersurface whose imprint could have survived till now. Using Bayesian probability concepts, we finally attempt to answer some fine-tuning objections recently moved to the pre-big bang scenario. '
9806231;'Transverse Lattice Approach to Light-Front Hamiltonian QCD';'S. Dalley (CERN), B. van de Sande (University of Erlangen)';'Mon, 29 Jun 1998 15:57:02 GMT   (101kb)';'   We describe a non-perturbative procedure for solving from first principles the light-front Hamiltonian problem of SU(N) pure gauge theory in D spacetime dimensions (D>2), based on enforcing Lorentz covariance of observables. A transverse lattice regulator and colour-dielectric link fields are employed, together with an associated effective potential. We argue that the light-front vacuum is necessarily trivial for large enough lattice spacing, and clarify why this leads to an Eguchi-Kawai dimensional reduction of observables to 1+1-dimensions in the infinite N limit. The procedure is then tested by explicit calculations for 2+1-dimensional SU(infinity) gauge theory, within a first approximation to the lattice effective potential. We identify a scaling trajectory which produces Lorentz covariant behaviour for the lightest glueballs. The predicted masses, in units of the measured string tension, are in agreement with recent results from conventional Euclidean lattice simulations. In addition, we obtain the potential between heavy sources and the structure of the glueballs from their light-front wavefunctions. Finally, we briefly discuss the extension of these calculations to 3+1-dimensions. '
9806233;'Quantum Fluctuations in Open Pre-Big Bang Cosmology';'A. Ghosh, G. Pollifrone and G. Veneziano (CERN)';'Mon, 29 Jun 1998 16:09:52 GMT   (10kb)';'   We solve exactly the (linear order) equations for tensor and scalar perturbations over the homogeneous, isotropic, open pre-big bang model recently discussed by several authors. We find that the parametric amplification of vacuum fluctuations (i.e. particle production) remains negligible throughout the perturbative pre-big bang phase. '

Argyres and Alex Buchel';'Mon, 29 Jun 1998 17:57:48 GMT   (12kb)';'   We argue that the topology of the quantum coupling space and the low energy effective action on the Coulomb branch of scale invariant N=2 SU(n) gauge theories pick out a preferred nonperturbative definition of the gauge coupling up to non-singular holomorphic reparametrizations.

9806235;'Remarks on the Heavy Quark Potential in the Supergravity Approach';'J. Greensite and P. Olesen';'Mon, 29 Jun 1998 18:42:05 GMT   (10kb)';'   We point out certain unexpected features of the planar QCD3 confining potential, as computed from a classical worldsheet action in an AdS metric via the Maldacena conjecture. We show that there is no Luscher c/R term in the static-quark potential, which is contrary to both the prediction of various effective string models, and the results of some recent lattice Monte Carlo studies. It is also noted that the glueball masses extracted from classical supergravity tend to finite, coupling-independent constants in the strong coupling limit, even as the string tension tends to infinity in the same limit; this is a counter-intuitive result. '
9806236;'Higher-Spin Gauge Interactions for Massive Matter Fields in 3D AdS';'Sergey Prokushkin and Mikhail Vasiliev (Lebedev Physics Institute)';'Mon, 29 Jun 1998 19:26:14 GMT   (45kb)';'   A remarkable feature of the models with interactions exhibiting higher-spin (HS) gauge symmetries in $d>2$ is that their most symmetric vacua require (anti)-de Sitter (AdS) geometry rather than the flat one. In striking parallelism to what might be expected of M theory HS gauge theories describe infinite towers of fields of all spins and possess naturally space-time SUSY and Chan-Paton type inner symmetries. In this paper, we analyze at the level of the equations of motion the simplest non-trivial HS model which describes HS gauge interactions (on the top of the usual supergravitational and (Chern-Simons) Yang-Mills interactions) of massive spin-0 and spin-1/2 matter fields in d=2+1 AdS space-time. The parameter of mass of the matter fields is identified with the vev of a certain auxiliary field in the model. The matter fields are shown to be arranged into d3 N=2 massive hypermultiplets in certain representations of $U(n)\times U(m)$ Yang-Mills gauge groups. Discrete symmetries of the full system are studied, and the related N=1 supersymmetric truncations with O(n) and Sp(n) Yang-Mills symmetries are constructed. The simplicity of the model allows us to elucidate some general properties of the HS models. In particular, a new result, which can have interesting implications to the higher-dimensional models, is that our model is shown to admit an "integrating" flow that proves existence of a non-local B\"acklund-Nicolai-type mapping to the free system. '
9806237;'Two-Monopole Systems and the Formation of Non-Abelian Clouds';'Changhai Lu';'Mon, 29 Jun 1998 19:59:23 GMT   (142kb)';'   We study the energy density of two distinct fundamental monopoles in SU(3) and Sp(4) theories with an arbitrary mass ratio. Several special limits of the general result are checked and verified. Based on the analytic expression of energy density the coefficient of the internal part of the moduli space metric is also computed, which gives it a nice "mechanical" interpretation. We then investigate the interaction energy density for both cases. By analyzing the contour of the zero interaction energy density we propose a detailed picture of what happens when one gets close to the massless limit. The study of the interaction energy density also sheds light on the formation of the non-Abelian cloud. '
9806238;'D_n Quivers From Branes';'Anton Kapustin';'Tue, 30 Jun 1998 02:14:19 GMT   (14kb)';'   D-branes can end on orbifold planes if the action of the orbifold group includes (-1)^{F_L}. We consider configurations of D-branes ending on such orbifolds and study the low-energy theory on their worldvolume. We apply our results to gauge theories with eight supercharges in three and four dimensions. We explain how mirror symmetry for N=4 d=3 gauge theories with gauge group Sp(k) and matter in the antisymmetric tensor and fundamental representations follows from S-duality of IIB string theory. We argue that some of these theories have hidden Fayet-Iliopoulos deformations, not visible classically. We also study a class of finite N=2 d=4 theories (so-called D_n quiver theories) and find their exact solution. The integrable model corresponding to the exact solution is a Hitchin system on an orbifold Riemann surface. We also give a simple derivation of the S-duality group of these theories based on their relationship to SO(2n) instantons on R^2\times T^2. '
9806239;'Holomorphic Chern-Simons-Witten Theory: from 2D to 4D Conformal Field';'A.D.Popov';'Tue, 30 Jun 1998 06:29:18 GMT   (34kb)';'   It is well known that rational 2D conformal field theories are connected with Chern-Simons theories defined on 3D real manifolds. We consider holomorphic analogues of Chern-Simons theories defined on 3D complex manifolds (six real dimensions) and describe 4D conformal field theories connected with them. All these models are integrable. We describe analogues of the Virasoro and affine Lie algebras, the local action of which on fields of holomorphic analogues of Chern-Simons theories becomes nonlocal after pushing down to the action on fields of integrable 4D conformal field theories. Quantization of integrable 4D conformal field theories and relations to string theories are briefly discussed. '
9806240;'Short-Distance Space-Time Structure and Black Holes in String Theory : A';'Miao Li and Tamiaki Yoneya';'Tue, 30 Jun 1998 06:03:59 GMT   (27kb)';'   We briefly review the present status of string theory from the viewpoint of its implications on the short-distance space-time structure and black hole physics. Special emphases are given on two closely related issues in recent developments towards nonperturbative string theory, namely, the role of the space-time uncertainty relation as a qualitative but universal characterization of the short-distance structure of string theory and the microscopic formulation of black-hole entropies. We will also suggest that the space-time uncertainty relation can be an underlying principle for the holographic property of M theory, by showing that the space-time uncertainty relation naturally explains the UV/IR relation used in a recent derivation of the holographic bound for D3 brane by Susskind and Witten.

9806241;'Euclidean and Lorentzian Quantum Gravity - Lessons from Two Dimensions';'J. Ambjorn, J.L. Nielsen, J. Rolf (Niels-Bohr-Institute), R. Loll';'Tue, 30 Jun 1998 11:25:39 GMT   (29kb)';'   No theory of four-dimensional quantum gravity exists as yet. In this situation the two-dimensional theory, which can be analyzed by conventional field-theoretical methods, can serve as a toy model for studying some aspects of quantum gravity. It represents one of the rare settings in a quantum-gravitational context where one can calculate quantities truly independent of any background geometry. We review recent progress in our understanding of 2d quantum gravity, and in particular the relation between the Euclidean and Lorentzian sectors of the quantum theory. We show that conventional 2d Euclidean quantum gravity can be obtained from Lorentzian quantum gravity by an analytic continuation only if we allow for spatial topology changes in the latter. Once this is done, one obtains a theory of quantum gravity where space-time is fractal: the intrinsic Hausdorff dimension of usual 2d Euclidean quantum gravity is four, and not two. However, certain aspects of quantum space-time remain two-dimensional, exemplified by the fact that its so-called spectral dimension is equal to two. '
9806242;'On Schwarzschild Black Hole in Large N Matrix theory';'Yi-hong Gao and Wei Zhang';'Tue, 30 Jun 1998 10:39:17 GMT   (5kb)';'   D0-brane gas picture of Schwarzschild black hole (SBH) is considered in the large N regime of Matrix theory. An entropy formula, which reproduces the thermodynamics of SBH in the large N limit for all dimensions ($D\geq 6$), is proposed. The equations of states for low temperature are obtained. We also give a proof of the Newton gravitation law between two SBHs, whose masses are not equal. Our result in some extent supports that the physics of Matrix theory is Lorentz invariant. '
9806243;'Lorentz covariance, higher-spin superspaces and self-duality';'Chandrashekar Devchand and Jean Nuyts';'Tue, 30 Jun 1998 10:39:49 GMT   (8kb)';'   Lorentz covariant generalisations of the notions of supersymmetry, superspace and self-duality are discussed. The essential idea is to extend standard constructions by allowing tangent vectors and coordinates which transform according to more general Lorentz representations than solely the spinorial and vectorial ones of standard lore. Such superspaces provide model configuration spaces for theories of arbitrary spin fields. Our framework is an elegant one for handling higher-dimensional theories in a manifestly SO(3,1) covariant fashion. A further application is the construction of a hierarchy of solvable Lorentz covariant systems generalising four-dimensional self-duality. '

The proof is done using Epstein-Glaser approach to renormalisation theory. '
9806245;'Evaporation of Schwarzschild Black Hole in the Large N Matrix Theory';'Yi-hong Gao and Wei Zhang';'Tue, 30 Jun 1998 11:16:33 GMT   (3kb)';'   By using the D0-brane cluster picture, we consider the Hawking radiation of Schwarszchild black hole (SBH) in large N Matrix model. We get the correct formula for the the Hawing evaporation rate. Our results give some evidence on the Lorentz invariance of the physics of Matrix model. '
9806246;'Duality Symmetries for N=2 Supersymmetric QCD with Vanishing';'Joseph A. Minahan (USC)';'Tue, 30 Jun 1998 16:49:29 GMT   (84kb)';'   We construct the duality groups for N=2 Supersymmetric QCD with gauge group SU(2n+1) and N_f=4n+2 hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation. The groups are generated by two elements $S$ and $T$ that satisfy a relation $(STS^{-1}T)^{2n+1}=1$. Thus, the groups are not subgroups of $SL(2,Z)$. We also construct automorphic functions that map the fundamental region of the group generated by $T$ and $STS$ to the Riemann sphere. These automorphic functions faithfully represent the duality symmetry in the Seiberg-Witten curve. '

Delbourgo';'Tue, 30 Jun 1998 18:01:52 GMT   (9kb)';'   A connection between one-loop $N$-point Feynman diagrams and certain geometrical quantities in non-Euclidean geometry is discussed. A geometrical way to calculate the corresponding Feynman integrals is considered. (This paper contains a brief review of the results presented in hep-th/9709216). '
9806249;'Putting an Edge to the Poisson Bracket';'K. Bering (MIT)';'Tue, 30 Jun 1998 21:52:40 GMT   (31kb)';'   We consider a general formalism for treating a Hamiltonian (canonical) field theory with a spatial boundary. In this formalism essentially all functionals are differentiable from the very beginning and hence no improvement terms are needed. We introduce a new Poisson bracket which differs from the usual ``bulk'' Poisson bracket with a boundary term and show that the Jacobi identity is satisfied. The result is geometrized on an abstract world volume manifold. The method is suitable for studying systems with a spatial edge like the ones often considered in Chern-Simons theory and General Relativity. Finally, we discuss how the boundary terms may be related to the time ordering when quantizing. '
9807201;'Spontaneous Magnetization in the Finite XXZ Spin Chain with Boundaries';'Yasuhiro Fujii and Miki Wadati';'Tue, 28 Jul 1998 07:18:33 GMT   (15kb)';'   The finite XXZ spin chain with boundaries is studied. We derive the transfer matrix from the q-difference equation discovered by Cherednik and construct its eigenstates by the vertex operator approach. We point out that the eigenstates with no magnetic fields have a symmetry called the turning symmetry. Making use of this symmetry we calculate the spontaneous magnetization in the thermodynamic limit, which is roughly twice as large as that in the half-infinite XXZ spin chain. '
9807202;'Superembedding approach and generalized action in String/M-theory';'Igor Bandos';'Tue, 28 Jul 1998 09:07:58 GMT   (11kb)';'   A brief introduction to superembedding approach (SEA) in its variant based on the generalized action principle (GAP) for super-p-branes is given. A role of harmonic variables for Lorentz group is stressed. A relation of the GAP with complete superfield actions is noted. Recent applications in studying of Dirichlet branes (super-Dp-branes) and M-branes are discussed. '
9807203;'BPS and non-BPS domain walls in supersymmetric QCD';'A.V. Smilga';'Tue, 28 Jul 1998 15:01:41 GMT   (33kb)';'   We study the spectrum of the domain walls interpolating between different chirally asymmetric vacua in supersymmetric QCD with the SU(N) gauge group and including N-1 pairs of chiral matter multiplets in fundamental and anti-fundamental representations. There are always "real walls" interpolating between the chirally symmetric and a chirally asymmetric vacua which are BPS saturated. For small enough masses, there are two different "complex" BPS wall solutions interpolating between different chirally asymmetric vacua and two types of "wallsome sphalerons". At some m = m_*, two BPS branches join together and, in some interval m_* < m < m_{**}, BPS equations have no solutions, but there are solutions to the equations of motion describing a non--BPS domain wall and a sphaleron. For m > m_{**}, there are no complex wall solutions whatsoever. '
9807205;'Anti-de Sitter Space and the Center of the Gauge Group';'Ofer Aharony and Edward Witten';'Tue, 28 Jul 1998 15:34:27 GMT   (14kb)';'   Upon compactification on a circle, SU(N) gauge theory with all fields in the adjoint representation acquires a $Z_N$ global symmetry because the center of the gauge group is $Z_N$. For N=4 super Yang-Mills theory, we show how this $Z_N$ "topological symmetry" arises in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and why the symmetry group is $Z_N$ rather than U(1). This provides a test of the AdS/CFT correspondence for finite N. If the theory is formulated on $R^3 \times S^1$ with anti-periodic boundary conditions for fermions around the $S^1$, the topological symmetry is spontaneously broken; we show that the domain walls are D-strings, and hence that flux tubes associated with magnetic confinement can end on the domain walls associated with the topological symmetry. For the (0,2) $A_{N-1}$ superconformal field theory in six dimensions, we demonstrate an analogous phenomenon: a $Z_N$ global symmetry group arises if this theory is compactified on a Riemann surface. In this case, the domain walls are M-theory membranes. '
9807206;'Superconformal Actions in Killing Gauge';'Renata Kallosh';'Tue, 28 Jul 1998 23:45:19 GMT   (9kb)';'   The classical superconformal actions of branes in adS superspaces have a closed form depending on a matrix $M^2$ quadratic in fermions, as found in hep-th/9805217. One can gauge-fix the local $\kappa$-symmetry using the Killing spinors of the brane in the bulk. We show that in such gauges the superconformal actions are simplified dramatically since $M^2=0$ in all cases. The relation between classical and gauge-fixed actions for these theories reflects the relation between the full superconformal algebra and its supersolvable subalgebra. '
9807207;'Complete Wetting of Gluons and Gluinos';'A. Campos, K. Holland and U.-J. Wiese';'Tue, 28 Jul 1998 16:36:08 GMT   (107kb)';'   Complete wetting is a universal phenomenon associated with interfaces separating coexisting phases. For example, in the pure gluon theory, at $T_c$ an interface separating two distinct high-temperature deconfined phases splits into two confined-deconfined interfaces with a complete wetting layer of confined phase between them. In supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, distinct confined phases may coexist with a Coulomb phase at zero temperature. In that case, the Coulomb phase may completely wet a confined-confined interface. Finally, at the high-temperature phase transition of gluons and gluinos, confined-confined interfaces are completely wet by the deconfined phase, and similarly, deconfined-deconfined interfaces are completely wet by the confined phase. For these various cases, we determine the interface profiles and the corresponding complete wetting critical exponents. The exponents depend on the range of the interface interactions and agree with those of corresponding condensed matter systems. '

This target space arises as the near horizon limit of a solitonic configuration in 2+2 dimensions. We investigate the null isometries of this space and discuss the reduction to 1+1 dimensions of the target space geometry arising from the consistent gauging of one of these isometries. '

Using the $D$-brane boundary state description we show the equivalence with a double extremal N=2 black hole solution of four dimensional supergravity. '
9807210;'On the quantum Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism and the renormalization of';'Glenn Barnich';'Tue, 28 Jul 1998 20:46:15 GMT   (21kb)';'   The most convenient tool to study the renormalization of a Lagrangian field theory invariant under non linear local or global symmetries is the proper solution to the master equation of the extended antifield formalism. It is shown that, from the knowledge of the BRST cohomology, it is possible to explicitly construct a further extension of the formalism containing all the observables of the theory and satisfying an extended master equation, with some of the features of the quantum Batalin-Vilkovisky master equation already present at the classical level. This solution has the remarkable property that all its infinitesimal deformations can be extended to complete deformations. The deformed solutions differs from the original one through the addition of terms related to coupling constant and anticanonical field-antifield redefinitions. As a consequence, all theories admitting an invariant regularization scheme are shown to be renormalizable while preserving the symmetries, in the sense that both the subtracted and the effective action satisfy the extended master equation, and this independently of power counting restrictions. The anomalous case is also studied and a suitable definition of the Batalin-Vilkovisky ``Delta'' operator in the context of dimensional renormalization is proposed. '

9807212;'Proper time derivatives in quantum mechanics';'Juan P. Aparicio, Fabian H. Gaioli, and Edgardo T. Garcia Alvarez';'Tue, 28 Jul 1998 22:07:27 GMT   (17kb)';'   Several quantum proper time derivatives are obtained from the Beck one in the usual framework of relativistic quantum mechanics (spin 1/2 case). The ``scalar Hamiltonians'' of these derivatives should be thought of as the conjugate variables of the proper time. Then, the Hamiltonians would play the role of mass operators, suggesting the formulation of an adequate extended indefinite mass framework. We propose and briefly develop the framework corresponding to the Feynman parametrization of the Dirac equation. In such a case we derive the other parametrizations known in the literature, linking the extension of the different proposals of quantum proper time derivatives again. '

Harvey';'Tue, 28 Jul 1998 22:38:00 GMT   (12kb)';'   In recent work Kachru, Kumar and Silverstein introduced a special class of non-supersymmetric type II string theories in which the cosmological constant vanishes at the first two orders of perturbation theory. Heuristic arguments suggest the cosmological constant may vanish in these theories to all orders in perturbation theory leading to a flat potential for the dilaton. A slight variant of their model can be described in terms of a dual heterotic theory. The dual theory has a non-zero cosmological constant which is non-perturbative in the coupling of the original type II theory. The dual theory also predicts a mismatch between Bose and Fermi degrees of freedom in the non-perturbative D-brane spectrum of the type II theory. '
9807214;'Spinors and Field Interactions in Higher Order Anisotropic Spaces';'Sergiu I. Vacaru';'Wed, 29 Jul 1998 09:20:46 GMT   (43kb)';'   We formulate the theory of field interactions with higher order anisotropy. The concepts of higher order anisotropic space and locally anisotropic space (in brief, ha-space and la-space) are introduced as general ones for various types of higher order extensions of Lagrange and Finsler geometry and higher dimension (Kaluza-Klein type) spaces. The spinors on ha-spaces are defined in the framework of the geometry of Clifford bundles provided with compatible nonlinear and distinguished connections and metric structures (d-connection and d-metric). The spinor differential geometry of ha-spaces is constructed. There are discussed some related issues connected with the physical aspects of higher order anisotropic interactions for gravitational, gauge, spinor, Dirac spinor and Proca fields. Motion equations in higher order generalizations of Finsler spaces, of the mentioned type of fields, are defined by using bundles of linear and affine frames locally adapted to the nonlinear connection structure.

9807215;'Deformation stability of BRST-quantization';'M. Duetsch, K. Fredenhagen';'Wed, 29 Jul 1998 10:21:40 GMT   (11kb)';'   To avoid the problems which are connected with the long distance behavior of perturbative gauge theories we present a local construction of the observables which does not involve the adiabatic limit. First we construct the interacting fields as formal power series by means of causal perturbation theory. The observables are defined by BRST invariance where the BRST-transformation $\tilde s$ acts as a graded derivation on the algebra of interacting fields. Positivity, i.e. the existence of Hilbert space representations of the local algebras of observables is shown with the help of a local Kugo-Ojima operator $Q_{\rm int}$ which implements $\tilde s$ on a local algebra and differs from the corresponding operator $Q$ of the free theory. We prove that the Hilbert space structure present in the free case is stable under perturbations. All assumptions are shown to be satisfied in QED in a finite spatial volume with suitable boundary conditions. As a by-product we find that the BRST-quantization is not compatible with periodic boundary conditions for massless free gauge fields. '
9807216;'Quantum three-dimensional de Sitter space';'Maximo Banados, Thorsten Brotz, Miguel Ortiz';'Wed, 29 Jul 1998 10:30:16 GMT   (10kb)';'   We compute the canonical partition function of 2+1 dimensional de Sitter space using the Euclidean $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ Chern-Simons formulation of 3d gravity with a positive cosmological constant. Firstly, we point out that one can work with a Chern-Simons theory with level $k=l/4G$, and its representations are therefore unitary for integer values of $k$. We then compute explicitly the partition function using the standard character formulae for SU(2) WZW theory and find agreement, in the large $k$ limit, with the semiclassical result. Finally, we note that the de Sitter entropy can also be obtained as the degeneracy of states of representations of a Virasoro algebra with $c=3l/2G$. '

In general, they will be curves lying on the spatial plane. We show how to treat the dynamics of the fermions in such a way that the existence of localized fermionic zero modes on the defects is transparent. Moreover, effects due to the higher, non zero modes, can be quantitatively studied. We also consider the relevance of the profile of the mass near the region where it changes sign. Finally, we apply our general results to the calculation of the induced fermionic current, in the linear response approximation, in the presence of an external electric field and defects. '

The calculation preserves chiral symmetry and confirms that a temperature dependence is compatible with axial anomaly saturation. The result checks soft-pions theorems at zero temperature as well as recent results in the literature for the pionic decay amplitude into static photons in the chirally symmetric phase. The case of chiral fermions is also considered. '
9807222;'The Confining N=1 Supersymmetric Gauge Theories: a Review';'Csaba Csaki (Berkeley)';'Wed, 29 Jul 1998 19:11:17 GMT   (10kb)';'   We give a classification and overview of the confining N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories. For simplicity we consider only theories based on simple gauge groups and no tree-level superpotential. Classification of these theories can be done according to whether or not there is a superpotential generated for the confined degrees of freedom. The theories with the superpotential include s-confining theories and also theories where the gauge fields participate in the confining spectrum, while theories with no superpotential include theories with a quantum deformed moduli space and theories with an affine moduli space.

In the large $k$ limit the zigzag symmetry can be obtained as a result of a self-consistent solution of the gravitationally dressed RG equation. The only solution found for simple group is $G=SL(2)$. More general target-space geometries can be obtained via tensoring of various cosets based on SL(2). In the supersymmetric case the zigzag symmetry fixes the maximal target-space dimension of the confining fermionic string to be seven. '
9807224;'Positivity Constraints on Anomalies and Supersymmetry';'A. Johansen';'Wed, 29 Jul 1998 21:25:57 GMT   (9kb)';'   The relation between the trace and R-current anomalies in 4D supersymmetric theories implies that the U(1)$_R$F$^2$, U(1)$_R$ and U(1)$^3_R$ anomalies which matched in studies of N=1 Seiberg duality satisfy positivity constraints. These constraints are tested in a large number of N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories in the non-Abelian Coulomb phase, and they are satisfied in all renormalizable models with unique anomaly-free R-current, including those with accidental symmetry. Most striking is the fact that the flow of the Euler anomaly coefficient, $a_{UV}-a_{IR}$, is always positive, as conjectured by Cardy. '

We show that the one-loop effective potential for excitations of the Yang-Mills field agrees with the classical linearized potential for brane waves in the AdS picture in the limit of long wavelengths. This supports the idea that the AdS/CFT correspondance fits into string theory as expected from previous work. '

9807228;'(Meta)stable closed vortices in 3+1 dimensional gauge theories with an';'Antti J. Niemi, Kaupo Palo and Sami Virtanen';'Thu, 30 Jul 1998 10:47:07 GMT   (118kb)';'   In gauge theories with an extended Higgs sector the classical equations of motion can have solutions that describe stable, closed finite energy vortices. Such vortices separate two disjoint Higgs vacua, with one of the vacua embedded in the other in a manner that forms a topologically nontrivial knot. The knottedness stabilizes the vortex against shrinkage in 3+1 dimensional space-time. But in a world with extra large dimensions we expect the configuration to decay by unknotting. As an example we consider the semilocal $\theta_W \to \frac{\pi}{2}$ limit of the Weinberg-Salam model. We present numerical evidence for the existence of a stable closed vortex, twisted into a toroidal configuration around a circular Higgs vacuum at its core. '
9807229;'Eleven-Dimensional Lorentz Symmetry from SUSY Quantum Mechanics';'David A.

In this paper, these considerations are extended to the quantum level and it is shown the algebra closes to leading nontrivial order at large N. A proposal is made for extending these results to Matrix theory by realizing longitudinal boosts as large N renormalization group transformations. '
9807230;'A Proposal on Some Microscopic Aspects of the AdS/CFT Duality';'Micha Berkooz (Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton)';'Thu, 30 Jul 1998 20:07:59 GMT   (26kb)';'   We suggest a model of the large N limit ${\cal N}=4$ D=4 SU(N) SYM as a gas of 3-branes in a 10 dimensional space. Field theory analysis suggests that this 10 dimensional space does not carry the usual gravity dynamics but rather a contraction of it. Using a non-local transformation some aspects of the dynamics of this system are mapped to the dynamics of standard gravitons on $AdS_5\times S^5$. In particular some of the correspondence between operator in the CFT and states on $AdS$ is more transparent. '
9807232;'String Interactions from Matrix String Theory';'G. Bonelli, L. Bonora, F. Nesti';'Thu, 30 Jul 1998 17:40:43 GMT   (63kb)';'   The Matrix String Theory, i.e. the two dimensional U(N) SYM with N=(8,8) supersymmetry, has classical BPS solutions that interpolate between an initial and a final string configuration via a bordered Riemann surface. The Matrix String Theory amplitudes around such a classical BPS background, in the strong Yang--Mills coupling, are therefore candidates to be interpreted in a stringy way as the transition amplitude between given initial and final string configurations. In this paper we calculate these amplitudes and show that the leading contribution is proportional to the factor g_s^{-\chi}, where \chi is the Euler characteristic of the interpolating Riemann surface and g_s is the string coupling. This is the factor one expects from perturbative string interaction theory. '

9807234;'Singular dimensions of the N=2 superconformal algebras. I';'Matthias Doerrzapf (Harvard) and Beatriz Gato-Rivera (IMAFF-CSIC)';'Thu, 30 Jul 1998 17:52:04 GMT   (44kb)';'   Verma modules of superconfomal algebras can have singular vector spaces with dimensions greater than 1. Following a method developed for the Virasoro algebra by Kent, we introduce the concept of adapted orderings on superconformal algebras. We prove several general results on the ordering kernels associated to the adapted orderings and show that the size of an ordering kernel implies an upper limit for the dimension of a singular vector space. We apply this method to the topological N=2 algebra and obtain the maximal dimensions of the singular vector spaces in the topological Verma modules: 0, 1, 2 or 3 depending on the type of Verma module and the type of singular vector. As a consequence we prove the conjecture of Gato-Rivera and Rosado on the possible existing types of topological singular vectors (4 in chiral Verma modules and 29 in complete Verma modules). Interestingly, we have found two-dimensional spaces of singular vectors at level 1. Finally, by using the topological twists and the spectral flows, we also obtain the maximal dimensions of the singular vector spaces for the Neveu-Schwarz N=2 algebra (0, 1 or 2) and for the Ramond N=2 algebra (0, 1, 2 or 3).

It is shown that the applied magnetic field inhomogeneously penetrates the sample with a spatial periodicity depending on a wavelength that decreases with temperature. The distribution of charges in the ($T\gg \omega_{c}$)-phase acquires a periodic spatial arrangement. '
9807239;'Interaction of D-string with F-string: A Path-Integral Formalism';'Supriya Kar and Yoichi Kazama';'Fri, 31 Jul 1998 03:58:30 GMT   (19kb)';'   A path integral formalism is developed to study the interaction of an arbitrary curved Dirichlet (D-) string with elementary excitations of the fundumental (F-) string in bosonic string theory. Up to the next to leading order in the derivative expansion, we construct the properly renormalized vertex operator, which generalizes the one previously obtained for a D-particle moving along a curved trajectory. Using this vertex, an attempt is further made to quantize the D-string coordinates and to compute the quantum amplitude for scattering between elementary excitations of the D- and F-strings. By studying the dependence on the Liouville mode for the D-string, it is found that the vertex in our approximation consists of an infinite tower of local vertex operators which are conformally invariant on their respective mass-shell. This analysis indicates that, unlike the D-particle case, an off-shell extension of the interaction vertex would be necessary to compute the full amplitude and that the realization of symmetry can be quite non-trivial when the dual extended objects are simultaneously present. Possible future directions are suggested. '

9807241;'Holography Principle and Topology Change in String Theory';'Soo-Jong Rey';'Fri, 31 Jul 1998 23:03:01 GMT   (9kb)';'   D-instantons of Type IIB string theory are Ramond-Ramond counterpart of Giddings-Strominger wormholes connecting two asymptotic regions of spacetime. Such wormholes, according to Coleman, might lead to spacetime topology change, third-quantized baby universes and probabilistic determination of fundamental coupling parameters. Utilizing correspondence between AdS5 x M5 Type IIB supergravity and d=4 super Yang-Mills theory, we point out that topology change and sum over topologies not only take place in string theory but also are required for consistency with holography. Nevertheless, the effects of D-instanton wormholes remain completely deterministic, in sharp contrast to Coleman's scenario. '

An effective potential is calculated in the leading order of the large-N expansion using the proper-time Schwinger formalism.   Phase transitions accompanying a chiral symmetry breaking in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model are studied in detail. A magnetic calalysis phenomenon is shown to exist in curved spacetime but it turns out to lose its universal character because the chiral symmetry is restored above some critical positive value of the spacetime curvature.

Actually, it increases the part with negative kinetic energy term at the spatial infinity. For this reason it does not change the conclusion, that at the spatial infinity the magnetic part of the electromagnetic field should be absent. '

For the class of commuting operators there are true quantum versions of the classical Sp(2)-antibrackets. For arbitrary operators we have a generalized bracket structure involving higher Sp(2)-antibrackets. It is shown that these quantum antibrackets may be obtained from generating operators involving operators in arbitrary involutions. A recently presented quantum master equation for operators, which was proposed to encode generalized quantum Maurer-Cartan equations for arbitrary open groups, is generalized to the Sp(2) formalism. In these new quantum master equations the generalized Sp(2)-brackets appear naturally. '

We find consistent boundary conditions for gauge fields in all instanton sectors. An extended Abelian projection with respect to the Polyakov loop operator is presented, where $A_0$ is independent of time and in the Cartan subalgebra. Fundamental domains for the gauge fixed $A_0$ are constructed for arbitrary gauge groups. In the sectors with non-vanishing instanton number such gauge fixings are necessarily singular. The singularities can be restricted to Dirac strings joining magnetically charged defects. The magnetic charges of these monopoles take their values in the co-root lattice of the gauge group. We relate the magnetic charges of the defects and the windings of suitable Higgs fields about these defects to the instanton number. '

The corresponding gauge invariant boundary conditions become dependent on tangential derivatives. Taking the four-sphere as a particular example, we calculate explicitly a number of the first heat kernel coefficients and obtain the general formulas that yields any desired coefficient. A remarkable observation is that the coefficient $a_2$, which defines the one-loop counterterm and the conformal anomaly, does not depend on the Chern-Simons coupling constant, while the heat kernel itself becomes singular at a certain (critical) value of the coupling. This could be a reflection of a general property of Chern-Simons theories. '

Gauge fixing kappa-symmetry in a way compatible with a static brane solution further reduces the fermionic dependence down to the fourth power. Subtleties of consistent gauge fixing worldvolume diffeomorphisms and kappa-symmetry of the superbrane actions are discussed. '

The boundary conditions constrain the quantum scalar field to vanish on two parallel planes separeted by a distance $a$ and the magnetic field is assumed to be constant, uniform and perpendicular to the planes. The effective Lagrangian is obtained using Schwinger's proper-time representation and exhibits new contributions generated by the boundary condition much in the same way as a material pressed between two plates exhibits new magnetic properties. The confined bosonic vacuum presents the expected diamagnetic properties and besides the new non-linear $a$-dependent contributions to the susceptibility we show that there exists also a new $a$-dependent contribution for the vacuum permeability in the linear approximation.

9810201;'Non-Spherical Horizons, I';'David R. Morrison and M. Ronen Plesser';'Fri, 23 Oct 1998 23:53:10 GMT   (72kb)';'   We formulate an extension of Maldacena's AdS/CFT conjectures to the case of branes located at singular points in the ambient transverse space. For singularities which occur at finite distance in the moduli space of M or F theory models with spacetime-filling branes, the conjectures identify the worldvolume theory on the p-branes with a compactification of M or IIB theory on $AdS_{p+2} \times H^{D-p-2}$. We show how the singularity determines the horizon H, and demonstrate the relationship between global symmetries on the worldvolume and gauge symmetries in the AdS model. As a first application, we study some singularities relevant to the D3-branes required in four-dimensional F-theory. For these we are able to explicitly derive the low-energy field theory on the worldvolume and compare its properties to predictions from the dual AdS model. In particular, we examine the baryon spectra of the models and the fate of the Abelian factors in the gauge group. '
9810202;'On the phase diagram of the discrete $Z_6$ spin models';'Patrick Dorey, Paolo Provero, Roberto Tateo and Stefano Vinti';'Mon, 26 Oct 1998 15:29:19 GMT   (18kb)';'   We point out some problems with the previously-proposed phase diagram of the $Z_6$ spin models. Consideration of the diagram near to the decoupling surface using both exact and approximate arguments suggests a modification which remedies these deficiencies. With the aid of a new parametrisation of the phase space, we study the models numerically, with results which support our conjectures. '
9810203;'SL(2,Z) S-duality of Super D-string Action in Type IIB Supergravity';'Ichiro Oda';'Sun, 25 Oct 1998 11:09:28 GMT   (10kb)';'   It is shown in a quantum-mechanically exact manner that a supersymmetric and $\kappa$-symmetric D-string action in a general type IIB supergravity background is transformed to a form of the type IIB Green-Schwarz superstring action with the SL(2,Z) covariant tension through an S-duality transformation. This result precisely proves a conjecture mentioned previously that the SL(2,Z) S-duality of a super D-string action in a flat background is also valid even in a curved IIB background geometry. We point further out the validity of the more generalized conjecture that various duality relations of super D-brane and M-brane actions originally found in a flat background also hold true in general ten dimensional type II supergravity and eleven dimensional supergravity background geometries by applying the present formalism to those cases.

Townsend';'Sun, 25 Oct 1998 13:56:37 GMT   (23kb)';'   We discuss some general features of black holes of five-dimensional supergravity, such as the first law of black hole mechanics. We also discuss some special features of rotating supersymmetric black holes. In particular, we show that the horizon is a non-singular, and {\sl non-rotating}, null hypersurface whose intersection with a Cauchy surface is a squashed 3-sphere. We find the Killing spinors of the near-horizon geometry and thereby determine the near-horizon isometry supergroup. '
9810205;'BTZ black holes from the five-dimensional general relativity with a';'Youngjai Kiem and Dahl Park';'Sun, 25 Oct 1998 18:31:00 GMT   (9kb)';'   We show that the five-dimensional general relativity with a negative cosmological constant allows the solutions of the form M_3 \times M_g where M_3 is the three-dimensional BTZ black hole and M_g is a higher genus (g>1) Riemann surface with a fixed size. It is shown that this type of spontaneous compactification on a Riemann surface is possible only for the genus larger than one. From type IIB string theory point of view, certain near horizon geometry of D three-branes wrapped on the compact Riemann surface (g>1) is the BTZ (or AdS_3) space-time tensored with the Riemann surface and a constant size five-sphere. The relevance of our analysis to the positive energy conjecture of Horowitz and Myers is discussed. '
9810206;'Non-Supersymmetric Conformal Field Theories from Stable Anti-de Sitter';'Jacques Distler and Frederic Zamora';'Mon, 26 Oct 1998 20:07:18 GMT   (101kb)';'   We describe new non-supersymmetric conformal field theories in three and four dimensions, using the CFT/AdS correspondence. In order to believe in their existence at large N_c and strong 't Hooft coupling, we explicitly check the stability of the corresponding non-supersymmetric anti-de Sitter backgrounds. Cases of particular interest are the relevant deformations of the N=4 SCFT in SU(3) and SO(5) invariant directions. It turns out that the former is a stable, and the latter an unstable non-supersymmetric type IIB background. '

Correlators of primary fields are calculated exactly in one-loop approximation for the pure extrinsic Polyakov action. Geometrical meaning of infrared singularity is discussed. The Nambu-Goto and spontaneous curvature actions are treated perturbatively. '
9810210;'Instanton Strings and HyperKaehler Geometry';'R. Dijkgraaf';'Mon, 26 Oct 1998 14:48:37 GMT   (29kb)';'   We discuss two-dimensional sigma models on moduli spaces of instantons on K3 surfaces. These N=(4,4) superconformal field theories describe the near-horizon dynamics of the D1-D5-brane system and are dual to string theory on AdS_3. We derive a precise map relating the moduli of the K3 type IIB string compactification to the moduli of these conformal field theories and the corresponding classical hyperkaehler geometry. We conclude that, in the absense of background gauge fields, the metric on the instanton moduli spaces degenerates exactly to the orbifold symmetric product of K3. Turning on a self-dual NS B-field deforms this symmetric product to a manifold that is diffeomorphic to the Hilbert scheme. We also comment on the mathematical applications of string duality to the global issues of deformations of hyperkaehler manifolds. '
9810211;'Generalized Calogero models through reductions by discrete symmetries';'Alexios P.

Such reductions reproduce all known variants of these systems, including some recently obtained generalizations of the spin-Sutherland model, and lead to further generalizations of the elliptic model involving spins with SU(n) non-invariant couplings.

9810212;'Higher order BRST and anti-BRST operators and cohomology for compact Lie';'C. Chryssomalakos, J. A. de Azcarraga, A. J. Macfarlane and J. C.';'Mon, 26 Oct 1998 15:44:30 GMT   (34kb)';'   After defining cohomologically higher order BRST and anti-BRST operators for a compact simple algebra {\cal G}, the associated higher order Laplacians are introduced and the corresponding supersymmetry algebra $\Sigma$ is analysed. These operators act on the states generated by a set of fermionic ghost fields transforming under the adjoint representation. In contrast with the standard case, for which the Laplacian is given by the quadratic Casimir, the higher order Laplacians $W$ are not in general given completely in terms of the Casimir-Racah operators, and may involve the ghost number operator. The higher order version of the Hodge decomposition is exhibited. The example of su(3) is worked out in detail, including the expression of its higher order Laplacian W. '
9810213;'Dualities and the SL(2,Z) Anomaly';'Sunil Mukhi (Harvard and Tata Institute)';'Mon, 26 Oct 1998 16:58:23 GMT   (11kb)';'   The SL(2,Z) anomaly recently derived for type IIB supergravity in 10 dimensions is shown to be a consequence of T-duality with the type IIA string, after compactification to 2 dimensions on an 8-fold. This explains the identity of the gravitational 8-forms appearing in different contexts in the effective actions of type IIA and IIB string theories. In this framework, constraints on the compactification manifold arise from modular invariance of the 2d theory. Related issues in 6 dimensions are examined, and it is argued that similar anomalies are present on the worldvolumes of M-theory 5-branes and orientifold 5-planes. '

In four dimensions the construction results in a Chan-Paton gauge group $U(8)\otimes U(12)\otimes U(12)$ with three generations of chiral fermions in the representations $(\overline{8},1,\overline{12}) +(8,12,1)+(1,\overline{66},1)+(1,1,66)$.

These are continua, lattices and a further short-distance structure which implies an ultraviolet cut-off. Under certain conditions, these cut-off degrees of freedom can reappear as internal degrees of freedom. We review the current status of the classification and present new conjectures. '

9810217;'The quantization of the chiral Schwinger model based on the BFT-BFV';'Mu-In Park, Young-Jai Park, and Sean J. Yoon';'Tue, 27 Oct 1998 06:13:10 GMT   (12kb)';'   We apply an improved version of Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin (BFT) Hamiltonian method to the a=1 chiral Schwinger Model, which is much more nontrivial than the a>1.$ one. Furthermore, through the path integral quantization, we newly resolve the problem of the non-trivial $\delta$ function as well as that of the unwanted Fourier parameter $\xi$ in the measure. As a result, we explicitly obtain the fully gauge invariant partition function, which includes a new type of Wess-Zumino (WZ) term irrelevant to the gauge symmetry as well as usual WZ action. '
9810218;'The quark-composites approach to QCD: The nucleons';'G. De Franceschi and F. Palumbo';'Tue, 27 Oct 1998 11:35:14 GMT   (15kb)';'   We present a new perturbative approach to QCD based on the use of quark composites with hadronic quantum numbers as fundamental variables. We apply it to the case of the nucleons by performing a nonlinear change of variables in the Berezin integral which defines the partition function of QCD. The nucleon composites are thereby assumed as new integration variables. We evaluate the jacobian and certain transformation functions which appear in the change of variables. We show that the free action of the nucleon composites is the Dirac action, and we evaluate the first perturbative contributions to their electroweak effective action, which turn out to be a pure renormalization. Our expansion is compatible with a perturbative as well as nonperturbative regime of the gluons and it has the characteristic feature that the confinement of the quarks is buit in. '
9810219;'Gauge Bundles and Born-Infeld on the Noncommutative Torus';'C. Hofman, E. Verlinde';'Tue, 27 Oct 1998 13:50:09 GMT   (20kb)';'   In this paper, we describe non-abelian gauge bundles with magnetic and electric fluxes on higher dimensional noncommutative tori. We give an explicit construction of a large class of bundles with nonzero magnetic 't Hooft fluxes. We discuss Morita equivalence between these bundles. The action of the duality is worked out in detail for the four-torus. As an application, we discuss Born-Infeld on this torus, as a description of compactified string theory. We show that the resulting theory, including the fluctuations, is manifestly invariant under the T-duality group SO(4,4;Z). The U-duality invariant BPS mass-formula is discussed shortly. We comment on a discrepancy of this result with that of a recent calculation. '
9810220;'Algebraic approach in unifying quantum integrable models';'Anjan Kundu';'Tue, 27 Oct 1998 14:05:02 GMT   (9kb)';'   A novel algebra underlying integrable systems is shown to generate and unify a large class of quantum integrable models with given $R$-matrix, through reductions of an ancestor Lax operator and its different realizations. Along with known discrete and field models a new class of inhomogeneous and impurity models are obtained. '
9810221;'The velocities of light in modified QED vacua';'K. Scharnhorst (Humboldt University Berlin)';'Tue, 27 Oct 1998 15:37:48 GMT   (19kb)';'   QED vacua under the influence of external conditions (background fields, finite temperature, boundary conditions) can be considered as dispersive media whose complex behaviour can no longer be described in terms of a single universal vacuum velocity of light c. Beginning in the early 1950's (J.S. Toll), quantum field theoretic investigations have led to considerable insight into the relation between the vacuum structure and the propagation of light. Recent years have witnessed a significant growth of activity in this field of research. After a short overview, two characteristic situations are discussed: the propagation of light in a constant homogeneous magnetic field and in a Casimir vacuum. The latter appears to be particularly interesting because the Casimir vacuum has been found to exhibit modes of the propagation of light with phase and group velocities larger than c in the low frequency domain omega<<m where m is the electron mass. The impact of this result on the front velocity of light in a Casimir vacuum is discussed by means of the Kramers-Kronig relation. '

The form of string corrections to the Wilson loop correlators, gauge boson propagator, effective potential is presented and possible relations to abelian projected QCD are outlined. '
9810223;'On Renormalization Group Flows and Exactly Marginal Operators in Three';'Matthew J. Strassler';'Tue, 27 Oct 1998 17:33:38 GMT   (34kb)';'   As in two and four dimensions, supersymmetric conformal field theories in three dimensions can have exactly marginal operators. These are illustrated in a number of examples with N=4 and N=2 supersymmetry. The N=2 theory of three chiral multiplets X,Y,Z and superpotential W=XYZ has an exactly marginal operator; N=2 U(1) with one electron, which is mirror to this theory, has one also. Many N=4 fixed points with superpotentials W \sim Phi Q_i \tilde Q^i have exactly marginal deformations consisting of a combination of Phi^2 and (Q_i \tilde Q^i)^2. However, N=4 U(1) with one electron does not; in fact the operator Phi^2 is marginally irrelevant. The situation in non-abelian theories is similar. The relation of the marginal operators to brane rotations is briefly discussed; this is particularly simple for self-dual examples where the precise form of the marginal operator may be guessed using mirror symmetry.

9810224;'Black Holes and the Super Yang-Mills diagram. II';'V. Sahakian and E. Martinec';'Tue, 27 Oct 1998 17:40:01 GMT   (23kb)';'   The complete phase diagram of objects in M-theory compactified on tori $T^p$, $p=1,2,3$, is elaborated. Phase transitions occur when the object localizes on cycle(s) (the Gregory-Laflamme transition), or when the area of the localized part of the horizon becomes one in string units (the Horowitz-Polchinski correspondence point). The low-energy, near-horizon geometry that governs a given phase can match onto a variety of asymptotic regimes. The analysis makes it clear that the matrix conjecture is a special case of the Maldacena conjecture. '
9810225;'Thermodynamics of spinning D3-branes';'Steven S. Gubser (Harvard)';'Tue, 27 Oct 1998 20:38:02 GMT   (29kb)';'   Spinning black three-branes in type IIB supergravity are thermodynamically stable up to a critical value of the angular momentum density. Inside the region of thermodynamic stability, the free energy from supergravity is roughly reproduced by a naive model based on free N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory on the world-volume. The field theory model correctly predicts a limit on angular momentum density, but near this limit it does not reproduce the critical exponents one can compute from supergravity. Analogies with Bose condensation and modified matrix models are discussed, and a mean field theory improvement of the naive model is suggested which corrects the critical exponents. '
9810226;'Novel supermultiplets of SU(2,2|4) and the AdS_5/CFT_4 duality';'M. Gunaydin, D. Minic and M. Zagermann';'Wed, 28 Oct 1998 00:19:32 GMT   (19kb)';'   We continue our study of the unitary supermultiplets of the N=8, d=5 anti-de Sitter (AdS_5) superalgebra SU(2,2|4), which is also the N=4 extended conformal superalgebra in d=4. We show explicitly how to go from the compact SU(2)XSU(2)XU(1) basis to the non-compact SL(2,C)XD basis of the positive energy unitary representations of the conformal group SU(2,2) in d=4. The doubleton representations of the AdS_5 group SU(2,2), which do not have a smooth Poincare limit in d=5, are shown to represent fields with vanishing masses in four dimensional Minkowski space. The unique CPT self-conjugate irreducible doubleton supermultiplet of SU(2,2|4)is simply the N=4 Yang-Mills supermultiplet in d=4. We study some novel short non-doubleton supermultiplets of SU(2,2|4) that have spin range 2 and that do not appear in the Kaluza-Klein spectrum of type IIB supergravity or in tensor products of the N=4 Yang-Mills supermultiplet with itself. These novel supermultiplets can be obtained from tensoring chiral doubleton supermultiplets, some of which we expect to be related to the massless limits of 1/4 BPS states. Hence, these novel supermultiplets may be relevant to the solitonic sector of IIB superstring and/or (p,q) superstrings over AdS_5 X S^5. '
9810227;'Non-Extreme Black Holes of Five Dimensional N=2 AdS Supergravity';'K. Behrndt, M. Cvetic, and W. A. Sabra';'Wed, 28 Oct 1998 00:56:55 GMT   (17kb)';'   We derive and analyse the full set of equations of motion for non-extreme static black holes (including examples with the spatial curvatures k=-1 and k=0) in D=5 N=2 gauged supergravity by employing the techniques of "very special geometry". These solutions turn out to differ from those in the ungauged supergravity only in the non-extremality function, which has an additional term (proportional to the gauge coupling g), responsible for the appearance of naked singularities in the BPS-saturated limit. We derive an explicit solution for the STU model of gauged supergravity which is incidentally also a solution of D=5 N=4 and N=8 gauged supergravity. This solution is specified by three charges, the asymptotic negative cosmological constant (minimum of the potential) and a non-extremality parameter. While its BPS-saturated limit has a naked singularity, we find a lower bound on the non-extremality parameter (or equivalently on the ADM mass) for which the non-extreme solutions are regular. When this bound is saturated the extreme (non-supersymmetric) solution has zero Hawking temperature and finite entropy. Analogous qualitative features are expected to emerge for black hole solutions in D=4 gauged supergravity as well. '
9810228;'Massive Fields with Arbitrary Integer Spin in Homogeneous';'S. M. Klishevich';'Wed, 28 Oct 1998 06:15:40 GMT   (13kb)';'   We study the interaction of gauge fields of arbitrary integer spins with the constant electromagnetic field. We reduce the problem of obtaining the gauge-invariant Lagrangian of integer spin fields in the external field to purely algebraic problem of finding a set of operators with certain features using the representation of the high-spin fields in the form of vectors in a pseudo-Hilbert space. We consider such a construction up to the second order in the electromagnetic field strength and also present an explicit form of interaction Lagrangian for a massive particle of spin $s$ in terms of symmetrical tensor fields in linear approximation. The result obtained does not depend on dimensionality of space-time. '
9810229;'Gauge Gravity and Conservation Laws in Higher Order Anisotropic Spaces';'Sergiu I. Vacaru';'Wed, 28 Oct 1998 10:28:27 GMT   (45kb)';'   We propose an approach to the theory of higher order anisotropic field interactions and curved spaces (in brief, ha-field, ha-interactions and ha-spaces). The concept of ha-space generalises various types of Lagrange and Finsler spaces and higher dimension (Kaluza-Klein) spaces. This work consists from two parts. In the first we outline the theory of Yang-Mills ha-fields and two gauge models of higher order anisotropic gravity are analyzed. The second is devoted to the theory of nearly autoparallel maps (na-maps) of locally anisotropic spaces (la-spaces) and to the problem of formulation of conservation laws for la-field interactions.   By defining invariants of na-map transforms we present a systematic classification of la-spaces. '

The {\it non-manifest} superconformal invariance of the superpotential term is shown to lead to a shift in the SO(2) charge by the value of its coefficient, which we identify as the orbital angular momentum. The full SU(1,1|2)-invariant dynamics is found from an extension to N=4 superconformal mechanics. '
9810231;'Arbitrary spin massless bosonic fields in d-dimensional anti-de Sitter';'R.R.Metsaev, (Lebedev Physical Institute)';'Wed, 28 Oct 1998 14:33:43 GMT   (9kb)';'   Arbitrary spin free massless bosonic fields propagating in even $d$ - dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime are investigated. Free wave equations of motion, subsidiary conditions and the corresponding gauge transformations for such fields are proposed. The lowest eigenvalues of the energy operator for the massless fields and the gauge parameter fields are derived. The results are formulated in $SO(d-1,2)$ covariant form as well as in terms of intrinsic coordinates. An inter-relation of two definitions of masslessness based on gauge invariance and conformal invariance is discussed. '
9810232;'The Feynman Variational Principle in the Worldline Representation of';'R. Rosenfelder (Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland), C. Alexandrou';'Wed, 28 Oct 1998 15:16:00 GMT   (5kb)';'   Following Feynman's treatment of the non-relativistic polaron problem, similar techniques are used to study relativistic field theories: after integrating out the bosonic degrees of freedom the resulting effective action is formulated in terms of particle trajectories (worldlines) instead of field operators. The Green functions of the theory are then approximated variationally on the pole of the external particles by using a retarded quadratic trial action. Application to a scalar theory gives non-perturbative, covariant results for vertex functions and scattering processes. Recent progress in dealing with the spin degrees of freedom in fermionic systems, in particular Quantum Electrodynamics, is discussed. We evaluate the averages needed in the Feynman variational principle for a general quadratic trial action and study the structure of the dressed fermion propagator. '
9810233;'Poisson Brackets of Normal-Ordered Wilson Loops';'C.-W. H. Lee and S. G. Rajeev';'Wed, 28 Oct 1998 19:59:05 GMT   (27kb)';'   We formulate Yang-Mills theory in terms of the large-N limit, viewed as a classical limit, of gauge-invariant dynamical variables, which are closely related to Wilson loops, via deformation quantization. We obtain a Poisson algebra of these dynamical variables corresponding to normal-ordered quantum (at a finite value of $\hbar$) operators. Comparing with a Poisson algebra one of us introduced in the past for Weyl-ordered quantum operators, we find, using ideas closly related to topological graph theory, that these two Poisson algebras are, roughly speaking, the same. More precisely speaking, there exists an invertible Poisson morphism between them. '

Damgaard';'Thu, 29 Oct 1998 10:40:37 GMT   (6kb)';'   We give a superfield formulation of the path integral on an arbitrary curved phase space, with or without first class constraints. Canonical tranformations and BRST transformations enter in a unified manner. The superpartners of the original phase space variables precisely conspire to produce the correct path integral measure, as Pfaffian ghosts. When extended to the case of second-class constraints, the correct path integral measure is again reproduced after integrating over the superpartners. These results suggest that the superfield formulation is of first-principle nature. '

Integrating the fermions, we find that each of the spacetime points X_{\nu}^{(i)} is equipped with a pair of su(2) Lie algebra valued pointlike singularities located at a distance m_{(f)} from the orientifold surface. On a four dimensional paraboloid embedded in the five dimensional Euclidean space, these singularities are recognized as the BPST instantons. '

9810241;'(In-)Consistencies in the relativistic description of excited states in';'S. Ahlig and R. Alkofer';'Thu, 29 Oct 1998 18:36:25 GMT   (122kb)';'   The Bethe-Salpeter equation provides the most widely used technique to extract bound states and resonances in a relativistic Quantum Field Theory. Nevertheless a thorough discussion how to identify its solutions with physical states is still missing. The occurrence of complex eigenvalues of the homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation complicates this issue further. Using a perturbative expansion in the mass difference of the constituents we demonstrate for scalar fields bound by a scalar exchange that the underlying mechanism which results in complex eigenvalues is the crossing of a normal (or abnormal) with an abnormal state. Based on an investigation of the renormalization of one-particle properties we argue that these crossings happen beyond the applicability region of the ladder Bethe-Salpeter equation. The implications for a fermion-antifermion bound state in QED are discussed, and a consistent interpretation of the bound state spectrum of QED is proposed. '

Vandoren';'Fri, 30 Oct 1998 00:46:50 GMT   (14kb)';'   We examine certain n-point functions G_n in {\cal N}=4 supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theory at the conformal point. In the large-N limit, we are able to sum all leading-order multi-instanton contributions exactly. We find compelling evidence for Maldacena's conjecture: (1) The large-N k-instanton collective coordinate space has the geometry of AdS_5 x S^5. (2) In exact agreement with type IIB superstring calculations, at the k-instanton level, $G_n = \sqrt{N} g^8 k^{n-7/2} e^{-8\pi^2 k/g^2}\sum_{d|k} d^{-2} \times F_n(x_1,...,x_n)$, where F_n is identical to a convolution of n bulk-to-boundary SUGRA propagators.

9810244;'Three Dimensional SCFT from M2 Branes at Conifold Singularities';'Kyungho Oh, Radu Tatar';'Fri, 30 Oct 1998 00:49:00 GMT   (14kb)';'   Recently it was conjectured that parallel branes at conical singularities are related to string/M theory on $AdS \times X$ where $X$ is an Einstein manifold. In this paper we consider coincident M2 branes near a conifold singularity when M theory is compactified on $AdS_4 \times Q^{1,1,1}$ where $Q^{1,1,1} = (SU(2) \times SU(2) \times SU(2))/(U(1) \times U(1))$ is a seven dimensional Sasaki-Einstein manifold. We argue that M theory on $AdS_4 \times Q^{1,1,1}$ can be described in terms of a three dimensional superconformal field theory.We use the fact that the three dimensional self-mirror duality is preserved by exact marginal operators, as observed by Strassler.

9810245;'T-Duality and Spinning Solutions in 2 + 1 Gravity';'Chiang-Mei Chen';'Fri, 30 Oct 1998 07:57:16 GMT   (10kb)';'   Starting with the 2+1 Einstein--Maxwell--Dilaton system with a cosmological constant and assuming two commuting Killing symmetries we derive the corresponding $1+0 \sigma$--model. It is shown that, for general values of the coupling parameters, the $T$--duality group is $SL(2,R)$, which coincides with the group of linear coordinate transformations along the Killing orbits. This duality, along with a suitable parameter choice, is applied to obtain some new spinning solutions in the alternative gravity theories: Einstein--Maxwell, Brans--Dicke and Einstein--Maxwell--Dilaton.

9810246;'Renorm-group, Causality and Non-power Perturbation Expansion in QFT';'D.V. Shirkov';'Fri, 30 Oct 1998 09:47:29 GMT   (12kb)';'   The structure of the QFT expansion is studied in the framework of a new "Invariant analytic" version of the perturbative QCD. Here, an invariant (running) coupling $a(Q^2/\Lambda^2)=\beta_1\alpha_s(Q^2)/4\pi$ is transformed into a "$Q^2$--analytized" invariant coupling $a_{\rm an}(Q^2/\Lambda^2) \equiv {\cal A}(x)$ which, by constuction, is free of ghost singularities due to incorporating some nonperturbative structures.   Meanwhile, the "analytized" perturbation expansion for an observable $F$, in contrast with the usual case, may contain specific functions ${\cal A}_n(x)= [a^n(x)]_{\rm an}$, the "n-th power of $a(x)$ analytized as a whole", instead of $({\cal A}(x))^n$. In other words, the pertubation series for $F(x)$, due to analyticity imperative, may change its form turning into an {\it asymptotic expansion \`a la Erd\'elyi over a nonpower set} $\{{\cal A}_n(x)\}$.   We analyse sets of functions $\{{\cal A}_n(x)\}$ and discuss properties of non-power expansion arising with their relations to feeble loop and scheme dependence of observables.   The issue of ambiguity of the invariant analytization procedure and of possible inconsistency of some of its versions with the RG structure is also discussed. '
9810247;'Are Strings Thermostrings?';'Zahid Zakir (Institute of Noosphere, Tashkent, Uzbekistan)';'Fri, 30 Oct 1998 12:14:01 GMT   (6kb)';'   In the method of thermostring quantization the time evolution of point particles at finite temperature kT is described in a geometric manner. The temperature paths of particles are represented as closed (thermo)strings, which are swept surfaces in space-time-temperature manifold. The method makes it possible a new physical interpretation of superstrings IIA and heterotic strings as point particles in a thermal bath with Planck temperature. '
9810248;'Logarithmic Universality in Random Matrix Theory';'K. Splittorff';'Fri, 30 Oct 1998 13:19:22 GMT   (11kb)';'   Universality in unitary invariant random matrix ensembles with complex matrix elements is considered. We treat two general ensembles which have a determinant factor in the weight. These ensembles are relevant, e.g., for spectra of the Dirac operator in QCD. In addition to the well established universality with respect to the choice of potential, we prove that microscopic spectral correlators are unaffected when the matrix in the determinant is replaced by an expansion in powers of the matrix. We refer to this invariance as logarithmic universality. The result is used in proving that a simple random matrix model with Ginsparg-Wilson symmetry has the same microscopic spectral correlators as chiral random matrix theory. '

An explicit expression for the string creation operator is obtained, both in terms of the Higgs field and in the dual formulation where a Kalb-Ramond antisymmetric tensor gauge field is employed as the basic field. The quantum string correlation function is evaluated and from this, the string energy density is obtained. Potential application in cosmology (cosmic strings) and condensed matter (vortices in superfluids) are discussed. '

We show that the asymptotic symmetry of two-dimensional (2D) Anti-de Sitter space is generated by a central extension of the Virasoro algebra. Using a canonical realization of this symmetry and Cardy's formula we calculate the statistical entropy of 2D black holes, which turns out to agree, up to a factor $\sqrt 2$, with the thermodynamical result.

When some of the Cartan generators do not imply any conditions on the physical states, the system contains the first and the second class constraints. After the introduction auxiliary bosonic degrees of freedom for these cases, the corresponding BRST charges with the nontrivial structure of nonlinear terms in ghosts are constructed. '

We show that in such models the low-energy effective theory near the origin of moduli space is an O'Raifeartaigh model, and the sign of the mass-squared for the pseudo-flat direction at the origin is calculable. We analyze vector-like models with gauge groups SU(N) and Sp(2N) with and without global symmetries. In all cases there is a stable minimum at the origin with an unbroken U(1)_R symmetry. '

In particular we focus on the brane box models of Hanany and Zaffaroni and show that after a T-duality transformation their M-theory embedding is described by supersymmetric 3-cycles; its geometry will encode the holomorphic non-perturbative information about the gauge theory.

This duality is distinct from mirror symmetry. To demonstrate duality we construct the gauge theories of interest using D2-branes and orientifolds and then consider their lift to M-theory. We also discuss the strong coupling limit of orientifold two-planes and orbifolds of orientifold six-planes. '

We construct a general formalism of worldvolume field theories in the language of quivers and give a procedure for computing the enlarged Kahler cone of the moduli space. The topology changing transitions achieved by varying the Fayet-Iliopoulos parameters correspond to changes of linearization of a geometric invariant theory quotient and can be studied by methods of algebraic geometry. Quite surprisingly, the structure of the enlarged Kahler cone can be computed by toric methods. By using this approach, we give a detailed discussion of two low-rank examples. '

They are specified by the induced spin and the induced gauge structures on the manifold. The configuration space of collective mode in the Skyrme model can be identified with $S^{3}$ and thus the quantization is not unique. This leads to the different predictions for the physical observables. '

9811205;'The Hausdorff dimension in polymerized quantum gravity';'Martin G. Harris and John F.

If the non-polymerized model has correlation function exponent $\eta_0 >3$ then $d_H=\gamma^{-1}$ where $\gamma$ is the susceptibility exponent. This suggests that these models may be in the same universality class as certain non-generic branched polymer models. '
9811206;'Schwinger Model Green functions with topological effects';'Tomasz Radozycki';'Tue, 24 Nov 1998 11:49:04 GMT   (17kb)';'   The fermion propagator and the 4-fermion Green function in the massless QED2 are explicitly found with topological effects taken into account. The corrections due to instanton sectors k=+1,-1, contributing to the propagator, are shown to be just the homogenous terms admitted by the Dyson-Schwinger equation for S. In the case of the 4-fermion function also sectors k=+2,-2 are included into consideration. The quark condensates are then calculated and are shown to satisfy cluster property. The theta-dependence exhibited by the Green functions corresponds to and may be removed by performing certain chiral gauge transformation. '

Then we investigate the scattering of well-separated dyons and find that their moduli space is a toric hyper-K\"ahler manifold. In addition, we present the worldvolume solitons of the D-3-brane which are related by duality to the M-theory configuration of two orthogonal membranes ending on a M-5-brane. We show that these solitons preserve 1/8 of supersymmetry and compute their effective action. '
9811208;'On the construction of gauge theories from non critical type 0 strings';'Gabriele Ferretti and Dario Martelli';'Tue, 24 Nov 1998 16:51:28 GMT   (10kb)';'   We investigate Polyakov's proposal of constructing Yang-Mills theories by using non critical type 0 strings. We break conformal invariance by putting the system at finite temperature and find that the entropy of the cosmological solutions for these theories matches that of a gas of weakly interacting Yang-Mills bosons, up to a numerical constant. The computation of the entropy using the effective action approach presents some novelties in that the whole contribution comes from the RR fields. We also find an area law and a mass gap in the theory and show that such behavior persists for $p>4$. We comment on the possible physical meaning of this result. '
9811209;'Superconformal Ward Identities for Green Functions with Multiple';'Johanna Erdmenger and Christian Rupp';'Tue, 24 Nov 1998 15:37:59 GMT   (28kb)';'   Superconformal Ward identities for N=1 supersymmetric quantum field theories in four dimensions are convenienty obtained in the superfield formalism by combining diffeomorphisms and Weyl transformations on curved superspace. Using this approach we study the superconformal transformation properties of Green functions with one or more insertions of the supercurrent to all orders in perturbation theory. For the case of two insertions we pay particular attention to fixing the additional counterterms present, as well as to the purely geometrical anomalies which contribute to the transformation behaviour. Moreover we show in a scheme-independent way how the quasi-local terms in the Ward identities are related to similar terms which contribute to the supercurrent two and three point functions.   Furthermore we relate our superfield approach to similar studies which use the component formalism by discussing the implications of our approach for the components of the supercurrent and of the supergravity prepotentials.

9811210;'Does the Weyl ordering prescription lead to the correct energy levels';'Jorge Ananias Neto and Wilson Oliveira(Departamento de Fisica,';'Tue, 24 Nov 1998 16:27:27 GMT   (12kb)';'   The energy eigenvalues of the quantum particle constrained in a surface of the sphere of D dimensions embedded in a $R^{D+1}$ space are obtained by using two different procedures: in the first, we derive the Hamiltonian operator by squaring the expression of the momentum, written in cartesian components, which satisfies the Dirac brackets between the canonical operators of this second class system. We use the Weyl ordering prescription to construct the Hermitian operators. When D=2 we verify that there is no constant parameter in the expression of the eigenvalues energy, a result that is in agreement with the fact that an extra term would change the level spacings in the hydrogen atom; in the second procedure it is adopted the non-abelian BFFT formalism to convert the second class constraints into first class ones. The non-abelian first class Hamiltonian operator is symmetrized by also using the Weyl ordering rule. We observe that their energy eigenvalues differ from a constant parameter when we compare with the second class system. Thus, a conversion of the D-dimensional sphere second class system for a first class one does not reproduce the same values. '
9811211;'Orbifold analysis of broken bulk symmetries';'J. Fuchs, C. Schweigert';'Tue, 24 Nov 1998 18:34:46 GMT   (16kb)';'   In two-dimensional conformal field theory, we analyze conformally invariant boundary conditions which break part of the bulk symmetries. When the subalgebra that is preserved by the boundary conditions is the fixed algebra under the action of a finite group G, orbifold techniques can be used to determine the structure of the space of such boundary conditions. We present explicit results for the case when G is abelian. In particular, we construct a classifying algebra which controls these symmetry breaking boundary conditions in the same way in which the fusion algebra governs the boundary conditions that preserve the full bulk symmetry.

9811212;'The Microscopic Spectral Density of the QCD Dirac Operator';'P.H. Damgaard, J.C. Osborn, D. Toublan, J.J.M. Verbaarschot';'Tue, 24 Nov 1998 22:54:31 GMT   (24kb)';'   We derive the microscopic spectral density of the Dirac operator in $SU(N_c\geq 3)$ Yang-Mills theory coupled to $N_f$ fermions in the fundamental representation. An essential technical ingredient is an exact rewriting of this density in terms of integrations over the super Riemannian manifold $Gl(N_f+1|1)$. The result agrees exactly with earlier calculations based on Random Matrix Theory. '

9811214;'3-manifold topology and the Donaldson-Witten partition function';'Marcos Marino and Gregory Moore';'Wed, 25 Nov 1998 15:15:14 GMT   (42kb)';'   We consider Donaldson-Witten theory on four-manifolds of the form $X=Y \times {\bf S}^1$ where $Y$ is a compact three-manifold. We show that there are interesting relations between the four-dimensional Donaldson invariants of $X$ and certain topological invariants of $Y$. In particular, we reinterpret a result of Meng-Taubes relating the Seiberg-Witten invariants to Reidemeister-Milnor torsion. If $b_1(Y)>1$ we show that the partition function reduces to the Casson-Walker-Lescop invariant of $Y$, as expected on formal grounds. In the case $b_1(Y)=1$ there is a correction. Consequently, in the case $b_1(Y)=1$, we observe an interesting subtlety in the standard expectations of Kaluza-Klein theory when applied to supersymmetric gauge theory compactified on a circle of small radius.

9811217;'Heterotic String/F-theory Duality from Mirror Symmetry';'P. Berglund and P. Mayr';'Wed, 25 Nov 1998 21:28:00 GMT   (52kb)';'   We use local mirror symmetry in type IIA string compactifications on Calabi-Yau n+1 folds $X_{n+1}$ to construct vector bundles on (possibly singular) elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau n-folds Z_n. The interpretation of these data as valid classical solutions of the heterotic string compactified on Z_n proves F-theory/heterotic duality at the classical level. Toric geometry is used to establish a systematic dictionary that assigns to each given toric n+1-fold $X_{n+1}$ a toric n fold Z_n together with a specific family of sheafs on it. This allows for a systematic construction of phenomenologically interesting d=4 N=1 heterotic vacua, e.g. on deformations of the tangent bundle, with grand unified and SU(3)\times SU(2) gauge groups. As another application we find non-perturbative gauge enhancements of the heterotic string on singular Calabi-Yau manifolds and new non-perturbative dualities relating heterotic compactifications on different manifolds.

9811218;'The Modular and Renormalisation Groups in the Quantum Hall Effect';'Brian P. Dolan';'Wed, 25 Nov 1998 12:37:57 GMT   (473kb)';'   An analytic form for the crossover of the conductivity tensor between two Hall plateaux, as a function of the external magnetic field, is proposed. The form of the crossover is obtained from the action of a symmetry group, a particular subgroup of the modular group, on the upper-half complex conductivity plane, by assuming that the beta-function describing the crossover is a holomorphic function of the conductivity. The group action also leads to a selection rule, |p_1q_2-p_2q_1|=1, for allowed transitions between Hall plateaux with filling factors p_1/q_1 and p_2/q_2, where q_1 and q_2 are odd. '
9811219;'Casimir Theory of the Relativistic Piecewise Uniform String';'I. Brevik';'Wed, 25 Nov 1998 12:39:43 GMT   (9kb)';'   The Casimir energy for the transverse oscillations of a piecewise uniform closed string is calculated. The string is relativistic in the sense that the velocity of transverse waves is always equal to c. The great adaptibility of this string model with respect to various regularization methods is pointed out. We survey several regularization methods: the cutoff method, the complex contour integration method, and the zeta-function method. The most powerful method in the present case is the contour integration method. The Casimir energy turns out to be negative, and the more so the larger is the number of pieces in the string. The thermodynamic free energy F is calculated for a two-piece string in the limit when the tension ratio x = T_I/T_II approaches zero. For large values of the length ratio s = L_II/L_I, the Hagedorn temperature becomes proportional to the square root of s. '
9811220;'Dynamical Aspects of Large N Reduced Models';'Tomohiro Hotta (Univ. of Tokyo), Jun Nishimura (Nagoya Univ. & NBI)';'Wed, 25 Nov 1998 14:57:37 GMT   (71kb)';'   We study the large N reduced model of D-dimensional Yang-Mills theory with special attention to dynamical aspects related to the eigenvalues of the N by N matrices, which correspond to the space-time coordinates in the IIB matrix model. We first put an upper bound on the extent of space time by perturbative arguments. We perform a Monte Carlo simulation and show that the upper bound is actually saturated. The relation of our result to the SSB of the U(1)^D symmetry in the Eguchi-Kawai model is clarified. We define a quantity which represents the uncertainty of the space-time coordinates and show that it is of the same order as the extent of space time, which means that a classical space-time picture is maximally broken. We develop a 1/D expansion, which enables us to calculate correlation functions of the model analytically. The absence of an SSB of the Lorentz invariance is shown by the Monte Carlo simulation as well as by the 1/D expansion. '
9811221;'Dynamical Generation of the Primordial Magnetic Field by Ferromagnetic';'Paolo Cea and Luigi Tedesco';'Wed, 25 Nov 1998 16:32:00 GMT   (13kb)';'   The spontaneous generation of uniform magnetic condensate in $QED_3$ gives rise to ferromagnetic domain walls at the electroweak phase transition. These ferromagnetic domain walls are caracterized by vanishing effective surface energy density avoiding, thus, the domain wall problem. Moreover we find that the domain walls generate a magnetic field $B \simeq 10^{24} Gauss$ at the electroweak scale which account for the seed field in the so called dynamo mechanism for the cosmological primordial magnetic field. We find that the annihilation processes of walls with size $R \simeq 10^5 Km$ could release an energy of order $10^{52} erg$ indicating the invisible ferromagnetic walls as possible compact sources of Gamma Ray Bursts.

9811222;'Functional Evolution of Free Quantum Fields';'C. G. Torre and M. Varadarajan';'Wed, 25 Nov 1998 17:59:21 GMT   (22kb)';'   We consider the problem of evolving a quantum field between any two (in general, curved) Cauchy surfaces. Classically, this dynamical evolution is represented by a canonical transformation on the phase space for the field theory. We show that this canonical transformation cannot, in general, be unitarily implemented on the Fock space for free quantum fields on flat spacetimes of dimension greater than 2. We do this by considering time evolution of a free Klein-Gordon field on a flat spacetime (with toroidal Cauchy surfaces) starting from a flat initial surface and ending on a generic final surface. The associated Bogolubov transformation is computed; it does not correspond to a unitary transformation on the Fock space. This means that functional evolution of the quantum state as originally envisioned by Tomonaga, Schwinger, and Dirac is not a viable concept. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that functional evolution of the quantum state can be satisfactorily described using the formalism of algebraic quantum field theory. We discuss possible implications of our results for canonical quantum gravity. '

It is revealed that this bracket has at once three nilpotent $\Delta$-like differential operators of the first, the second and the third orders with respect to the Grassmann derivatives. It is shown that these $\Delta$-like operators together with the Grassmann-odd nilpotent Casimir function of this bracket form a finite-dimensional Lie superalgebra. '
9811224;'Remarks on Two-Loop Free Energy in N=4 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory';'A. Fotopoulos and T.R. Taylor';'Wed, 25 Nov 1998 19:34:58 GMT   (51kb)';'   The strong coupling behavior of finite temperature free energy in N=4 supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills theory has been recently discussed by Gubser, Klebanov and Tseytlin in the context of AdS-SYM correspondence. In this note, we focus on the weak coupling behavior. As a result of a two-loop computation we obtain, in the large N 't Hooft limit, $F(g^2N\to 0)\approx -\frac{\pi^2}{6}N^2V_3T^4(1-\frac{3}{2\pi^2}g^2N)$. Comparison with the strong coupling expansion provides further indication that free energy is a smooth monotonic function of the coupling constant. '
9811225;'Light-front Quantized Chiral Schwinger Model and its Vacuum Structure';'Prem P. Srivastava (Theoretical Physics Group, SLAC, Stanford, CA)';'Thu, 26 Nov 1998 00:53:05 GMT   (14kb)';'   The bosonized Chiral Schwinger model (CSM) is quantized on the light-front (LF). The physical Hilbert space of CSM is obtained directly once the constraints on the LF phase space are eliminated. The discussion of the degenerate vacua and the absence in the CSM of the $\theta$-vacua, as found in the Schwinger model (SM), becomes straightforward. The differences in the structures of the the mass excitations and the vacua in these gauge theories are displayed transparently. The procedure followed is the one used successfully in the previous works for describing the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) and the SM on the LF. The physical contents following from the LF quantized theory agree with those known in the conventional treatment. The LF hyperplane is argued to be equally appropriate as the conventional equal-time one for the canonical quantization.

9811226;'Niemeier self-dual lattices and topological phase transitions';'S.A.Bulgadaev (Landau Institute, Moscow)';'Thu, 26 Nov 1998 14:17:34 GMT   (6kb)';'   A topological phase transition in two-dimensional nonlinear sigma-models on tori, connected with self-dual (unimodular) 24-dimensional Niemeier lattices, is considered. It is shown that critical properties of these transitions are determined by corresponding Coxeter numbers of lattices. A case of general integer-valued lattices with minimal norm equal 1 or 2 and a possible application to string theory are discussed. '
9811227;'Nuclearity and split for thermal quantum field theories';'Christian Jaekel';'Thu, 26 Nov 1998 16:06:54 GMT   (25kb)';'   We review the heuristic arguments suggesting that any thermal quantum field theory, which can be interpreted as a quantum statistical mechanics of (interacting) relativistic particles, obeys certain restrictions on its number of local degrees of freedom. As in the vacuum representation, these restrictions can be expressed by a `nuclearity condition'. If a model satisfies this nuclearity condition, then the net of von Neumann algebras representing the local observables in the thermal representation has the split property. '
9811228;'Quartic Gauge Couplings from K3 Geometry';'W. Lerche, S. Stieberger and N.P. Warner';'Thu, 26 Nov 1998 17:30:54 GMT   (32kb)';'   We show how certain F^4 couplings in eight dimensions can be computed using the mirror map and K3 data. They perfectly match with the corresponding heterotic one-loop couplings, and therefore this amounts to a successful test of the conjectured duality between the heterotic string on T^2 and F-theory on K3. The underlying quantum geometry appears to be a 5-fold, consisting of a hyperk"ahler 4-fold fibered over a IP^1 base. The natural candidate for this fiber is the symmetric product Sym^2(K3). We are lead to this structure by analyzing the implications of higher powers of E_2 in the relevant Borcherds counting functions, and in particular the appropriate generalizations of the Picard-Fuchs equations for the K3.

9811229;'Classical description of spinning degrees of freedom of relativistic';'A.A. Deriglazov and D.M. Gitman';'Thu, 26 Nov 1998 21:17:13 GMT   (11kb)';'   We consider a possibility to describe spin one-half and higher spins of massive relativistic particles by means of commuting spinors. We present two classical gauge models with the variables $x^\mu,\xi_\alpha,\chi_\alpha$, where $\xi,\chi$ are commuting Majorana spinors. In course of quantization both models reproduce Dirac equation. We analyze the possibility to introduce an interaction with an external electromagnetic background into the models and to generalize them to higher spin description. The first model admits a minimal interaction with the external electromagnetic field, but leads to reducible representations of the Poincare group being generalized for higher spins. The second model turns out to be appropriate for description of the massive higher spins. However, it seams to be difficult to introduce a minimal interaction with an external electromagnetic field into this model. We compare our approach with one, which uses Grassman variables, and establish a relation between them. '
9811230;'Generalized Conifolds and 4d N=1 SCFT';'S.Gubser, N. Nekrasov, S. L. Shatashvili';'Fri, 27 Nov 1998 22:10:19 GMT   (53kb)';'   This paper lays groundwork for the detailed study of the non-trivial renormalization group flow connecting supersymmetric fixed points in four dimensions using string theory on AdS spaces. Specifically, we consider D3-branes placed at singularities of Calabi-Yau threefolds which generalize the conifold singularity and have an ADE classification. The $\CN=1$ superconformal theories dictating their low-energy dynamics are infrared fixed points arising from deforming the corresponding ADE $\CN=2$ superconformal field theories by mass terms for adjoint chiral fields. We probe the geometry with a single $D3$-brane and discuss the near-horizon supergravity solution for a large number $N$ of coincident $D3$-branes. '
9811231;'The Quantum Noether Condition in terms of interacting fields';'Tobias Hurth and Kostas Skenderis';'Fri, 27 Nov 1998 22:40:47 GMT   (27kb)';'   We review our recent work, hep-th/9803030, on the constraints imposed by global or local symmetries on perturbative quantum field theories. The analysis is performed in the Bogoliubov-Shirkov-Epstein-Glaser formulation of perturbative quantum field theory. In this formalism the S-matrix is constructed directly in the asymptotic Fock space with only input causality and Poincare invariance. We reformulate the symmetry condition proposed in our earlier work in terms of interacting Noether currents. '
9811232;'Partial breaking of global D=4 supersymmetry, constrained superfields,';'M. Rocek and A.A. Tseytlin';'Fri, 27 Nov 1998 09:25:06 GMT   (25kb)';'   We show that the connection between partial breaking of supersymmetry and nonlinear actions is not accidental and has to do with constraints that lead directly to nonlinear actions of the Born-Infeld type. We develop a constrained superfield approach that gives a universal way of deriving and using these actions. In particular, we find the manifestly supersymmetric form of the action of the 3-brane in 6-dimensional space in terms of N=1 superfields by using the tensor multiplet as a tool. We explain the relation between the Born-Infeld action and the model of partial N=2 supersymmetry breaking by a dual D-term. We represent the Born-Infeld action in a novel form quadratic in the gauge field strengths by introducing two auxiliary complex scalar fields; this makes duality covariance and the connection with the N=1 supersymmetric extension of the action very transparent. We also suggest a general procedure for deriving manifestly duality symmetric actions, explaining in a systematic way relations between previously discussed Lorentz covariant and noncovariant actions.

9811233;'Current trends in axiomatic quantum field theory';'Detlev Buchholz';'Fri, 27 Nov 1998 09:36:15 GMT   (23kb)';'   In this article a non--technical survey is given of the present status of Axiomatic Quantum Field Theory and interesting future directions of this approach are outlined. The topics covered are the universal structure of the local algebras of observables, their relation to the underlying fields and the significance of their relative positions. Moreover, the physical interpretation of the theory is discussed with emphasis on problems appearing in gauge theories, such as the revision of the particle concept, the determination of symmetries and statistics from the superselection structure, the analysis of the short distance properties and the specific features of relativistic thermal states. Some problems appearing in quantum field theory on curved spacetimes are also briefly mentioned.   (Talk given at Ringberg Symposium on Quantum Field Theory, Ringberg Castle, June 1998) '

Larsen';'Fri, 27 Nov 1998 09:42:30 GMT   (7kb)';'   A two dimensional anomaly cancellation argument is used to construct the SO(32) heterotic and type IIB membranes. By imposing different boundary conditions at the two boundaries of a membrane, we shift all of the two dimensional anomaly to one of the boundaries. The topology of these membranes is that of a 2-dimensional cone propagating in the 11-dimensional target space. Dimensional reduction of these membranes yields the SO(32) heterotic and type IIB strings. '
9811235;'A continuum limit of the chiral Jacobian in lattice gauge theory';'Kazuo Fujikawa (Department of Physics, University of Tokyo)';'Fri, 27 Nov 1998 10:00:13 GMT   (11kb)';'   We study the implications of the index theorem and chiral Jacobian in lattice gauge theory, which have been formulated by Hasenfratz, Laliena and Niedermayer and by L\"{u}scher, on the continuum formulation of the chiral Jacobian and anomaly. We take a continuum limit of the lattice Jacobian factor without referring to perturbative expansion and recover the result of continuum theory by using only the general properties of the lattice Dirac operator. This procedure is based on a set of well-defined rules and thus provides an alternative approach to the conventional analysis of the chiral Jacobian and related anomaly in continuum theory. By using an explicit form of the lattice Dirac operator introduced by Neuberger, which satisfies the Ginsparg-Wilson relation, we illustrate our calculation in some detail. We also briefly comment on the index theorem with a finite cut-off from the present viewpoint. '
9811236;'Pressure of the Non-equilibrium O(N) Phi^{4} Theory in the Large N Limit';'P.Jizba and E.S.Tututi (DAMTP-Cambridge)';'Fri, 27 Nov 1998 11:45:47 GMT   (152kb)';'   We calculate the off-equilibrium hydrostatic pressure for the O(N) Phi^{4} theory to the leading order in 1/N. The present paper, the first of a series, concentrates on the calculation of pressure in the non-equilibrium but translationally invariant medium. The Jaynes-Gibbs principle of maximal entropy is used to introduce the relevant density matrix which is then directly implemented into dynamical equations through generalised Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) conditions. We show that in the large N limit use of Ward identities enables the pressure to be expressed in terms of two point Green's functions. These satisfy the Kadanoff-Baym equations which are exactly solvable, and we explicitly calculate the pressure for three illustrative choices of \rho. '
9811237;'Boundary Deformation Theory and Moduli Spaces of D-Branes';'A. Recknagel and V. Schomerus';'Fri, 27 Nov 1998 12:20:46 GMT   (60kb)';'   Boundary conformal field theory is the suitable framework for a microscopic treatment of D-branes in arbitrary CFT backgrounds. In this work, we develop boundary deformation theory in order to study the changes of boundary conditions generated by marginal boundary fields. The deformation parameters may be regarded as continuous moduli of D-branes. We identify a large class of boundary fields which are shown to be truly marginal, and we derive closed formulas describing the associated deformations to all orders in perturbation theory. This allows us to study the global topology properties of the moduli space rather than local aspects only. As an example, we analyse in detail the moduli space of c=1 theories, which displays various stringy phenomena. '
9811238;'The baby Skyrme models and their multi-skyrmions';'Tom Weidig (Centre for Particle Theory, University of Durham)';'Fri, 27 Nov 1998 12:39:57 GMT   (431kb)';'   We study the structure of minimal-energy solutions of the baby Skyrme models for any topological charge n; the baby multi-skyrmions. Unlike in the (3+1)D nuclear Skyrme model, a potential term must be present in the (2+1)D Skyrme model to ensure stability. The form of this potential term has a crucial effect on the existence and structure of baby multi-skyrmions. The simplest holomorphic model has no known stable minimal-energy solution for n greater than one. The other baby Skyrme model studied in the literature possesses non-radially symmetric minimal-energy configurations that look like `skyrmion lattices' formed by skyrmions with n=2. We discuss a baby Skyrme model with a potential that has two vacua. Surprisingly, the minimal-energy solution for every n is radially-symmetric and the energy grows linearly for large n. Further, these multi-skyrmions are tighter bound, have less energy and the same large r behaviour than in the model with one vacuum. We rely on numerical studies and approximations to test and verify this observation. '
9811239;'The associative algebras of conformal field theory';'David Brungs and Werner Nahm';'Fri, 27 Nov 1998 17:02:42 GMT   (5kb)';'   Modulo the ideal generated by the derivative fields, the normal ordered product of holomorphic fields in two-dimensional conformal field theory yields a commutative and associative algebra. The zero mode algebra can be regarded as a deformation of the latter. Alternatively, it can be described as an associative quotient of the algebra given by a modified normal ordered product. We clarify the relation of these structures to Zhu's product and Zhu's algebra of the mathematical literature. '
9811240;'Toric geometry and F-theory/Heterotic Duality in Four Dimensions';'Govindan Rajesh';'Fri, 27 Nov 1998 17:34:18 GMT   (30kb)';'   We study, as hypersurfaces in toric varieties, elliptic Calabi-Yau fourfolds for F-theory compactifications dual to E8xE8 heterotic strings compactified to four dimensions on elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds with some choice of vector bundle. We describe how to read off the vector bundle data for the heterotic compactification from the toric data of the fourfold. This map allows us to construct, for example, Calabi-Yau fourfolds corresponding to three generation models with unbroken GUT groups. We also find that the geometry of the Calabi-Yau fourfold restricts the heterotic vector bundle data in a manner related to the stability of these bundles. Finally, we study Calabi-Yau fourfolds corresponding to heterotic models with fivebranes wrapping curves in the base of the Calabi-Yau threefolds. We find evidence of a topology changing extremal transition on the fourfold side which corresponds, on the heterotic side, to fivebranes wrapping different curves in the same homology class in the base.

9811241;'Dirac Variables and Zero Modes of Gauss Constraint in Finite-Volume';'S. Gogilidze, N. Ilieva, V.N. Pervushin';'Fri, 27 Nov 1998 18:21:55 GMT   (11kb)';'   The finite-volume QED$_{1+1}$ is formulated in terms of Dirac variables by an explicit solution of the Gauss constraint with possible nontrivial boundary conditions taken into account. The intrinsic nontrivial topology of the gauge group is thus revealed together with its zero-mode residual dynamics. Topologically nontrivial gauge transformations generate collective excitations of the gauge field above Coleman's ground state, that are completely decoupled from local dynamics, the latter being equivalent to a free massive scalar field theory.

9811242;'Dirac fields in a Bohm-Aharonov background and spectral boundary';'C. G. Beneventano, M. De Francia and E. M. Santangelo';'Fri, 27 Nov 1998 18:37:48 GMT   (8kb)';'   We study the problem of a Dirac field in the background of an Aharonov-Bohm flux string. We exclude the origin by imposing spectral boundary conditions at a finite radius then shrinked to zero. Thus, we obtain a behaviour of the eigenfunctions which is compatible with the self-adjointness of the radial Hamiltonian and the invariance under integer translations of the reduced flux. After confining the theory to a finite region, we check the consistency with the index theorem, and discuss the vacuum fermionic number and Casimir energy. '
9811243;'A speculative remark on holography';'R. Dawid';'Fri, 27 Nov 1998 19:28:01 GMT   (12kb)';'   Holography suggests a considerable reduction of degrees of freedom in theories with gravity. However it seems to be difficult to understand how holography could be realized in a closed re--contracting universe. In this letter we claim that a scenario which achieves that goal will eliminate all spatial degrees of freedom. This would require a different concept of quantum mechanics and would imply an intriguing increase of power for the natural laws. '
9811244;'Partial breaking of N=1, D=10 supersymmetry';'S. Bellucci, E. Ivanov, S. Krivonos';'Sat, 28 Nov 1998 17:23:45 GMT   (15kb)';'   We describe the spontaneous partial breaking of $N=1 D=10$ supersymmetry to $N=(1,0) d=6$ and its dimensionally-reduced versions in the framework of the nonlinear realizations method. The basic Goldstone superfield is $N=(1,0) d=6$ hypermultiplet superfield satisfying a nonlinear generalization of the standard hypermultiplet constraint. We interpret the generalized constraint as the manifestly worldvolume supersymmetric form of equations of motion of the Type I super 5-brane in D=10. The related issues we address are a possible existence of brane extension of off-shell hypermultiplet actions, the possibility to utilize vector $N=(1,0) d=6$ supermultiplet as the Goldstone one, and the description of 1/4 breaking of $N=1 D=11$ supersymmetry.

9811246;'Can conformal Transformations change the fate of 2D black holes?';'J. Cruz, A. Fabbri and J. Navarro-Salas';'Mon, 30 Nov 1998 10:40:45 GMT   (8kb)';'   By using a classical Liouville-type model of two dimensional dilaton gravity we show that the one-loop theory implies that the fate of a black hole depends on the conformal frame. There is one frame for which the evaporation process never stops and another one leading to a complete disappearance of the black hole. This can be seen as a consequence of the fact that thermodynamic variables are not conformally invariant. In the second case the evaporation always produces the same static and regular end-point geometry, irrespective of the initial state. '

Wipf';'Mon, 30 Nov 1998 18:02:51 GMT   (17kb)';'   We investigate the Abelian projection with respect to the Polyakov loop operator for SU(N) gauge theories on the four torus. The gauge fixed $A_0$ is time-independent and diagonal. We construct fundamental domains for $A_0$. In sectors with non-vanishing instanton number such gauge fixings are always singular. The singularities define the positions of magnetically charged monopoles, strings or walls. These magnetic defects sit on the Gribov horizon and have quantized magnetic charges. We relate their magnetic charges to the instanton number. '

Assuming that the quantum field is in the vacuum state, I show that, when in {\it inertial} motion, the detector responds {\it only} when the electromagnetic background produces particles. However, I find that the response of the detector is {\it not} proportional to the number of particles produced by the background. '
9811251;'N=8 BPS black holes preserving 1/8 supersymmetry';'M. Bertolini, P. Fre`, M. Trigiante';'Mon, 30 Nov 1998 18:49:14 GMT   (27kb)';'   In the context of N=8 supergravity we consider BPS black-holes that preserve 1/8 supersymmetry. It was shown in a previous paper that, modulo U-duality transformations of E_{7(7)} the most general solution of this type can be reduced to a black-hole of the STU model. In this paper we analize this solution in detail, considering in particular its embedding in one of the possible Special K\"ahler manifold compatible with the consistent truncations to N=2 supergravity, this manifold being the moduli space of the T^6/Z^3 orbifold, that is: SU(3,3)/SU(3)*U(3). This construction requires a crucial use of the Solvable Lie Algebra formalism. Once the group-theoretical analisys is done, starting from a static, spherically symmetric ans\"atz, we find an exact solution for all the scalars (both dilaton and axion-like) and for gauge fields, together with their already known charge-dependent fixed values, which yield a U-duality invariant entropy. We give also a complete translation dictionary between the Solvable Lie Algebra and the Special K\"ahler formalisms in order to let comparison with other papers on similar issues being more immediate. Although the explicit solution is given in a simplified case where the equations turn out to be more manageable, it encodes all the features of the more general one, namely it has non-vanishing entropy and the scalar fields have a non-trivial radial dependence.

9811252;'Linear Odd Poisson Bracket on Grassmann Variables';'V.A. Soroka';'Mon, 30 Nov 1998 18:01:28 GMT   (5kb)';'   A linear odd Poisson bracket (antibracket) realized solely in terms of Grassmann variables is suggested. It is revealed that the bracket, which corresponds to a semi-simple Lie group, has at once three Grassmann-odd nilpotent $\Delta$-like differential operators of the first, the second and the third orders with respect to Grassmann derivatives, in contrast with the canonical odd Poisson bracket having the only Grassmann-odd nilpotent differential $\Delta$-operator of the second order. It is shown that these $\Delta$-like operators together with a Grassmann-odd nilpotent Casimir function of this bracket form a finite-dimensional Lie superalgebra. '
9811253;'Generalized Gauge Transformations and Regularized $\lambda\phi^4$-type';'Winder A. Moura-Melo and J.A. Helayel-Neto';'Mon, 30 Nov 1998 18:59:17 GMT   (10kb)';'   Abelian Lagrangians containing Phi^4-type vertices are regularized by means of a suitable point-splitting scheme combined with generalized gauge transformations.. The calculation is developed in details for a general Lagrangean, whose fields (gauge and matter ones) satisfy usual conditions. We illustrate our results by considering some special cases, such as the ($\overline{\psi}\psi)^2 and a modified version of the Avddev-Chizhov models. Possible application of our results to the Abelian Higgs model, whenever spontaneous symmetry breaking is considered, is also discussed. We also pay attention to a number of features of the point-split action such as the regularity and non-locality of its new ``interacting terms''. '
9811254;'The Light-Cone Vacuum in 1+1 Dimensional Super-Yang-Mills Theory';'F.Antonuccio, O.Lunin, S.Pinsky, S.Tsujimaru';'Mon, 30 Nov 1998 22:14:52 GMT   (14kb)';'   The Discrete Light-Cone Quantization (DLCQ) of a supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theory in 1+1 dimensions is discussed, with particular emphasis given to the inclusion of all dynamical zero modes. Interestingly, the notorious `zero-mode problem' is now tractable because of special supersymmetric cancellations. In particular, we show that anomalous zero-mode contributions to the currents are absent, in contrast to what is observed in the non-supersymmetric case. We find that the supersymmetric partner of the gauge zero mode is the diagonal component of the fermion zero mode. An analysis of the vacuum structure is provided and it is shown that the inclusion of zero modes is crucial for probing the phase properties of the vacua. In particular, we find that the ground state energy is zero and N-fold degenerate, and thus consistent with unbroken supersymmetry. We also show that the inclusion of zero modes for the light-cone supercharges leaves the supersymmetry algebra unchanged. Finally, we remark that the dependence of the light-cone Fock vacuum in terms of the gauge zero is unchanged in the presence of matter fields. '
9811255;'Screening of Fractional Charges in (2+1)-dimensional QED';'D. Diakonov, K. Zarembo';'Mon, 30 Nov 1998 23:29:03 GMT   (66kb)';'   We show that the logarithmically rising static potential between opposite-charged sources in two dimensions is screened by dynamical fields even if the probe charges are fractional, in units of the charge of the dynamical fields. The effect is due to quantum mechanics: the wave functions of the screening charges are superpositions of two bumps localized both near the opposite- and the same-charge sources, so that each of them gets exactly screened. '
9811256;'Hamiltonian Approach to Poisson Lie T-Duality';'A. Stern';'Mon, 30 Nov 1998 23:45:59 GMT   (12kb)';'   The Hamiltonian formalism offers a natural framework for discussing the notion of Poisson Lie T-duality. This is because the duality is inherent in the Poisson structures alone and exists regardless of the choice of Hamiltonian. Thus one can pose alternative dynamical systems possessing nonabelian T-duality. As an example, we find a dual Hamiltonian formulation of the O(3) nonlinear sigma-model. In addition, starting from a general quadratic Hamiltonian, we easily recover the known dynamical systems having Poisson Lie T-duality. '
9811257;'General Scalar Exchange in AdS_d+1';'Eric D'Hoker and Daniel Z. Freedman';'Tue, 1 Dec 1998 00:32:22 GMT   (46kb)';'   The scalar field exchange diagram for the correlation function of four scalar operators is evaluated in anti-de Sitter space, $AdS_{d+1}$. The conformal dimensions $\Delta_i$, $i=1,...,4$ of the scalar operators and the dimension $\Delta$ of the exchanged field are arbitrary, constrained only to obey the unitarity bound. Techniques similar to those developed earlier for gauge boson exchange are used, but results are generally more complicated. However, for integer $\Delta_i, \Delta$, the amplitude can be presented as a multiple derivative of a simple universal function. Results simplify if further conditions hold, such as the inequalities, $\Delta< \Delta_1+\Delta_3$ or $\Delta<\Delta_2+\Delta_4$. These conditions are satisfied, with $<$ replaced by $\le$, in Type IIB supergravity on $AdS_5\times S_5$ because of selection rules from SO(6) symmetry. A new form of interaction is suggested for the marginal case of the inequalities. The short distance asymptotics of the amplitudes are studied. In the direct channel the leading singular term agrees with the double operator product expansion. Logarithmic singularities occur at sub-leading order in the direct channel but at leading order in the crossed channel. When the inequalities above are violated, there are also $(\log)^2$ singularities in the direct channel. '
9811258;'D-branes on Three-dimensional Nonabelian Orbifolds';'Tomomi Muto';'Tue, 1 Dec 1998 00:41:12 GMT   (8kb)';'   We study D-branes on a three complex dimensional nonabelian orbifold ${\bf C}^3/\Gamma$ with $\Gamma$ a finite subgroup of SU(3). We present general formulae necessary to obtain quiver diagrams which represent the gauge group and the spectrum of the D-brane worldvolume theory for dihedral-like subgroups $\Delta(3n^2)$ and $\Delta(6n^2)$. It is found that the quiver diagrams have a similar structure to webs of branes. '

It reviews some general aspects of string theory from the viewpoint of the search for an unifying theory. Here, special emphasis lies on the motivation to consider string theory not only as the leading candidate for the unification of gravity and the other fundamental forces of nature, but also as a possible step towards a new understanding of nature and its description within the framework of physical models. Without going into details, some recent developments, including duality symmetries and the appearance of $M$--theory, are reviewed. '
9812202;'Effective actions on the squashed three-sphere';'J.S.Dowker';'Tue, 22 Dec 1998 13:29:44 GMT   (25kb)';'   The effective actions of a scalar and massless spin-half field are determined as functions of the deformation of a symmetrically squashed three-sphere. The extreme oblate case is particularly examined as pertinant to a high temperature statistical mechanical interpretation that may be relevant for the holographic principle. Interpreting the squashing parameter as a temperature, we find that the effective `free energies' on the three-sphere are mixtures of thermal two-sphere scalars and spinors which, in the case of the spinor on the three-sphere, have the `wrong' thermal periodicities. However the free energies do have the same leading high temperature forms as the standard free energies on the two-sphere. The next few terms in the high-temperature expansion are also explicitly calculated and briefly compared with the Taub-Bolt-AdS bulk result. '

9812204;'Topological Aspects of Quantum Chromodynamics';'Gerard 't Hooft';'Tue, 22 Dec 1998 14:31:14 GMT   (17kb)';'   Absolute confinement of its color charges is a natural property of gauge theories such as quantum chromodynamics. On the one hand, it can be attributed to the existence of color-magnetic monopoles, a topological feature of the theory, but one can also maintain that all non-Abelian gauge theories confine. It is illustrated how ``confinement'' works in the SU(2) sector of the Standard Model, and why for example the electron and its neutrino can be viewed as SU(2)-hadronic bound states rather than a gauge doublet.   The mechanism called `Abelian projection' then puts the Abelian sector of any gauge theory on a separate footing. '

9812207;'Dilaton transformation under abelian and non-abelian T-duality in the';'J.De Jaegher, J. Raeymaekers, A. Sevrin and W. Troost';'Tue, 22 Dec 1998 17:06:35 GMT   (26kb)';'   We present a convenient method for deriving the transformation of the dilaton under T-duality in the path-integral approach. Subtleties arising in performing the integral over the gauge fields are carefully analysed using Pauli-Villars regularization, thereby clarifying existing ambiguities in the literature. The formalism can not only be applied to the abelian case, but, and this for the first time, to the non-abelian case as well. Furthermore, by choosing a particular gauge, we directly obtain the target-space covariant expression for the dual geometry in the abelian case. Finally it is shown that the conditions for gauging non-abelian isometries are weaker than those generally found in the literature. '
9812208;'A simplified version of Higher Covariant Derivative regularization';'T. D.

9812209;'Uncovering Infinite Symmetries on [p,q] 7-branes: Kac-Moody Algebras and';'Oliver DeWolfe, Tamas Hauer, Amer Iqbal and Barton Zwiebach';'Tue, 22 Dec 1998 18:00:14 GMT   (64kb)';'   In a previous paper we explored how conjugacy classes of the modular group classify the symmetry algebras that arise on type IIB [p,q] 7-branes. The Kodaira list of finite Lie algebras completely fills the elliptic classes as well as some parabolic classes. Loop algebras of E_N fill additional parabolic classes, and exotic finite algebras, hyperbolic extensions of E_N and more general indefinite Lie algebras fill the hyperbolic classes. Since they correspond to brane configurations that cannot be made into strict singularities, these non-Kodaira algebras are spectrum generating and organize towers of massive BPS states into representations. The smallest brane configuration with unit monodromy gives rise to the loop algebra \hat{E}_9 which plays a central role in the theory. We elucidate the patterns of enhancement relating E_8, E_9, \hat{E}_9 and E_10. We examine configurations of 24 7-branes relevant to type IIB compactifications on a two-sphere, or F-theory on K3. A particularly symmetric configuration separates the 7-branes into two groups of twelve branes and the massive BPS spectrum is organized by E_10 + E_10. '
9812210;'The Non-Perturbative SO(32) Heterotic String';'C.M. Hull';'Tue, 22 Dec 1998 18:23:58 GMT   (10kb)';'   The SO(32) heterotic string can be obtained from the type IIB string by gauging a discrete symmetry that acts as $(-1)^{F_L}$ on the perturbative string states and reverses the parity of the D-string. Consistency requires the presence of 32 NS 9-branes -- the S-duals of D9-branes -- which give SO(32) Chan-Paton factors to open D-strings. At finite string coupling, there are SO(32) charges tethered to the heterotic string world-sheet by open D-strings. At zero-coupling, the D-string tension becomes infinite and the SO(32) charges are pulled onto the world-sheet, and give the usual SO(32) world-sheet currents of the heterotic string. '
9812211;'Anharmonic oscillators, the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, and nonlinear';'Patrick Dorey and Roberto Tateo';'Tue, 22 Dec 1998 20:25:51 GMT   (11kb)';'   The spectral determinant $D(E)$ of the quartic oscillator is known to satisfy a functional equation. This is mapped onto the $A_3$-related $Y$-system emerging in the treatment of a certain perturbed conformal field theory, allowing us to give an alternative integral expression for $D(E)$. Generalising this result, we conjecture a relationship between the $x^{2M}$ anharmonic oscillators and the $A_{2M-1}$ TBA systems. Finally, spectral determinants for general $|x|^{\alpha}$ potentials are mapped onto the solutions of nonlinear integral equations associated with the (twisted) XXZ and sine-Gordon models. '
9812212;'Degeneration of ALF D_n Metrics';'G. Chalmers, M. Rocek, S. Wiles';'Tue, 22 Dec 1998 22:18:41 GMT   (24kb)';'   Beginning with the Legendre transform construction of hyperk\"ahler metrics, we analyze the ALF version of the D_n metrics. We determine the constraint equation obtained from extremizing the $w$ coordinate of the generating function F(z,\bar{z},u,\bar{u},w) and study its behavior as we send two of the mass parameters of the $D_n$ metric to zero. We find that the constraint equation enforces the limit that the metric becomes that of multi-Taub-NUT. '
9812213;'A New Approach to Axial Vector Model Calculations II';'F. A. Dilkes, D. G. C. McKeon and Christian Schubert';'Wed, 23 Dec 1998 20:55:38 GMT   (32kb)';'   We further develop the new approach, proposed in part I (hep-th/9807072), to computing the heat kernel associated with a Fermion coupled to vector and axial vector fields. We first use the path integral representation obtained for the heat kernel trace in a vector-axialvector background to derive a Bern-Kosower type master formula for the one-loop amplitude with $M$ vectors and $N$ axialvectors, valid in any even spacetime dimension. For the massless case we then generalize this approach to the full off-diagonal heat kernel. In the D=4 case the SO(4) structure of the theory can be broken down to $SU(2) \times SU(2)$ by use of the 't Hooft symbols. Various techniques for explicitly evaluating the spin part of the path integral are developed and compared. We also extend the method to external fermions, and to the inclusion of isospin. On the field theory side, we obtain an extension of the second order formalism for fermion QED to an abelian vector-axialvector theory. '

We get the bright N-solitons solution by solving the integrable uncoupled NLS of Manakov type. We also find that there is an elastic collision of the bright N-solitons. '
9812216;'Light-Cone Gauge Quantization of String Theories on $AdS_3$ Space';'Ming Yu and Bo Zhang';'Wed, 23 Dec 1998 10:06:44 GMT   (20kb)';'   Light-cone gauge quantization procedures are given, for superstring theory on $AdS_3$ space charged with NS-NS background, both in NSR and GS formalism. The spacetime (super)conformal algebras are constructed in terms of the transversal physical degrees of freedom. The spacetime conformal anomaly agrees with that of covariant formalism, provided that the worldsheet conformal anomaly $c$ equals 26 or 15 for bosonic string or superstring, respectively. The spacetime (super)conformal field theory is found to correspond to orbifold construction on symmetric product space $\it{Sym_p} {\cal{M}}/Z_p$. '
9812217;'Canonical Quantization for the Light-Front Weyl Gauge';'Jerzy A. Przeszowski (IFTR PAC, Warsaw)';'Wed, 23 Dec 1998 10:19:20 GMT   (22kb)';'   The canonical quantization on a single light front is performed for the Abelian gauge fields with the Weyl gauge coupled with fermion field currents. The analysis is carried separately for 1+1 dimensions and for higher dimensions. The Gauss law, implemented weakly as the condition on states, selects physical subspace with the Poincare covariance recovered. The perturbative gauge field propagators are found with the ML prescription for their spurious poles. The LF Feynman rules are found and their equivalence with the usual equal-time perturbation for the S-matrix elements is studied for all orders. '
9812218;'AdS_7/CFT_6 Correspondence and Matrix Models of M5-Branes';'Hidetoshi Awata, Shinji Hirano';'Wed, 23 Dec 1998 10:21:05 GMT   (29kb)';'   We study the large N limit of matrix models of M5-branes, or (2,0) six-dimensional superconformal field theories, by making use of the Bulk/Boundary correspondence. Our emphasis is on the relation between the near-horizon limit of branes and the light-like limit of M-theory. In particular we discuss a conformal symmetry in the D0 + D4 system, and interpret it as a conformal symmetry in the discrete light-cone formulation of M5-branes. We also compute two-point functions of scalars by applying the conjecture for the AdS/CFT correspondence to the near-horizon geometry of boosted M5-branes. We find an expected result up to a point subtle, but irrelevant to the IR behavior of the theory. Our analysis matches with the Seiberg and Sen's argument of a justification for the matrix model of M-theory. '
9812219;'Noncommutative Open String and D-brane';'Chong-Sun Chu and Pei-Ming Ho';'Wed, 23 Dec 1998 10:41:27 GMT   (15kb)';'   In this paper we consider the quantization of open strings ending on D-branes with a background B field. We find that spacetime coordinates of the open string end-points become noncommutative, and correspondingly the D-brane worldvolume also becomes noncommutative. This provides a string theory derivation and generalization of the noncommutativity obtained previously in the Matrix model compactification. For Dp-branes with p>=2 our results are new and agree with that of Matrix theory for the case of A=0 (where $A$ is the worldvolume gauge field) if the T-duality radii are used. '
9812220;'Near-Horizon Supergravity Superspace';'Piet Claus';'Wed, 23 Dec 1998 11:06:05 GMT   (7kb)';'   We present a construction of the superspace of maximally supersymmetric adS_{p+2} x S^{d-p-2} near-horizon geometry based entirely on the supergravity constraints of which the bosonic space is a solution. Besides the geometric superfields, i.e. the vielbeine and the spinconnection, we also derive the isometries of the superspace together with the compensating tangent space transformations to all orders in anticommuting superspace coordinates.

One-loop contributions of boson and fermion fluctuations to the gauge field energy have been calculated. '

Kopf';'Wed, 23 Dec 1998 13:14:22 GMT   (11kb)';'   In this work we apply the Lie group representation method introduced in the real time formalism for finite-temperature quantum-field theory, thermofield dynamics, to derive a spinorial density matrix equation. Symmetry properties of such equation are analysed, and as a basic result it is shown that one solution is the generalised density matrix operator proposed by Heinz, to deal with gauge covariant kinetic equations. In the same context, preliminary aspects of a Lagrangian formalism to derive kinetic equations, as well as quantum density matrix equations in curved space-time, are discussed. '
9812223;'Galilei covariance and (4,1) de Sitter space';'A. E. Santana, F. C. Khanna and Y. Takahashi';'Wed, 23 Dec 1998 19:23:53 GMT   (9kb)';'   A vector space G is introduced such that the Galilei transformations are considered linear mappings in this manifold. The covariant structure of the Galilei Group (Y. Takahashi, Fortschr. Phys. 36 (1988) 63; 36 (1988) 83) is derived and the tensor analysis is developed. It is shown that the Euclidean space is embedded the (4,1) de Sitter space through in G. This is an interesting and useful aspect, in particular, for the analysis carried out for the Lie algebra of the generators of linear transformations in G. '
9812224;'Spacetime-Filling Branes and Strings with Sixteen Supercharges';'E. Bergshoeff, E. Eyras, R. Halbersma, C.M. Hull, Y. Lozano, J.P. van';'Wed, 23 Dec 1998 20:05:43 GMT   (51kb)';'   We discuss branes whose worldvolume dimension equals the target spacetime dimension, i.e. ``spacetime-filling branes''. In addition to the D9-branes, there are 9-branes in the NS-NS sectors of both the IIA and IIB strings. The worldvolume actions of these branes are constructed, via duality, from the known actions of branes with codimension larger than zero. Each of these types of branes is used in the construction of a string theory with sixteen supercharges by modding out a type II string by an appropriate discrete symmetry and adding 32 9-branes. These constructions are related by a web of dualities and each arises as a different limit of the Horava-Witten construction. '
9812225;'Brane Actions and String Dualities';'Eduardo Eyras and Yolanda Lozano';'Wed, 23 Dec 1998 20:41:52 GMT   (13kb)';'   An effective action for the M9-brane is proposed. We study its relation with other branes via dualities. Among these, we find actions for branes which are not suggested by the central charges of the Type II superalgebras. '
9812226;'D-branes in Orbifold Singularities and Equivariant K-Theory';'Hugo Garcia-Compean';'Wed, 23 Dec 1998 22:23:00 GMT   (27kb)';'   The study of brane-antibrane configurations in string theory leads to the understanding of supersymmetric D$p$-branes as the bound states of higher dimensional branes. Configurations of pairs brane-antibrane do admit in a natural way their description in terms of K-theory. We analyze configurations of brane-antibrane at fixed point orbifold singularities in terms of equivariant K-theory as recently suggested by Witten. Type I and IIB fivebranes and small instantons on ALE singularities are described in K-theoretic terms and their relation to Kronheimer-Nakajima construction of instantons is also provided. Finally the D-brane charge formula is reexamined in this context. '
9812227;'String Junctions and the BPS Spectrum of N=2 SU(2) Theory with Massive';'Yukiko Ohtake';'Thu, 24 Dec 1998 05:34:27 GMT   (314kb)';'   We study the BPS spectrum of four dimensional N=2 SU(2) theory with massive fundamental matters using the D3-brane probe. Since the BPS states are realized by string webs subject to the BPS conditions, we determine explicitly the configurations of such webs. It is observed that there appear BPS string webs with multiple of junctions corresponding to the fact that the curves of marginal stability in massive theory are infinitely nested. In terms of the string configurations, various properties of the curves of marginal stability are explained intuitively. '
9812228;'Radiative Effects in Gauge Models with Homogeneous Condensate and Curved';'V.Ch.Zhukovsky, V.V.Khudyakov, I.V.Mamsurov';'Thu, 24 Dec 1998 13:21:43 GMT   (7kb)';'   Different models with nonabelian homogeneous condensate fields are considered in the one-loop approximation. Effective action in a model of gluodynamics in curved space is calculated. Free energy and its minimum in a (2+1)-dimensional model of QCD are investigated. Photon polarization operator (PO) is obtained. '
9812229;'World-line approach to the Bern-Kosower formalism in two-loop Yang-Mills';'Haru-Tada Sato and Michael G. Schmidt (Heidelberg U.)';'Thu, 24 Dec 1998 19:20:39 GMT   (32kb)';'   Based on the world-line formalism with a sewing method, we derive the Yang-Mills effective action in a form useful to generate the Bern-Kosower-type master formulae for gluon scattering amplitudes at the two-loop level. It is shown that four-gluon ($\Phi^4$ type sewing) contributions can be encapsulated in the action with three-gluon ($\Phi^3$ type) vertices only, the total action thus becoming a simple expression. We then derive a general formula for a two-loop Euler-Heisenberg type action in a pseudo-abelian $su(2)$ background. The ghost loop and fermion loop cases are also studied. '
9812230;'Path-Integral Formulation of Dirichlet String in General Backgrounds';'Supriya Kar';'Thu, 24 Dec 1998 22:15:15 GMT   (19kb)';'   We investigate the dynamics of an arbitrary Dirichlet (D-) string in presence of general curved backgrounds following a path-integral formalism. In particular, we consider the interaction of D-string with the massless excitations of closed string in open bosonic string theory. The background fields induce invariant curvatures on the D-string manifold and the extrinsic curvature can be seen to contain a divergence at the disk boundary. The re-normalization of D-string coordinates, next to the leading order in its derivative expansion, is performed to handle the divergence. Then we obtain the generalized Dirac-Born-Infeld action representing the effective dynamics of D-string in presence of the non-trivial backgrounds. On the other hand, D-string acts as a source for the Ramond-Ramond two-form which induces an additional (lower) form due to its coupling to the U(1) gauge invariant fields on the D-string. These forms are reviewed in this formalism for an arbitrary D-string and is encoded in the Wess-Zumino action. Quantization of the D-string collective coordinates, in the U(1) gauge sector, is performed by taking into account the coupling to the lower form and the relevant features of D-string are analyzed in presence of the background fields.

The spontaneous breakdown of the gauge symmetry is guaranteed provided the chiral fermions exist in more than one generations as first observed by Connes-Lott. It is also pointed out that the most general gauge invariant lagrangian in the bosonic sector has two more parameters than in the original Connes-Lott scheme. '
9812232;'Calogero-Moser Models III: Elliptic Potentials and Twisting';'A.J. Bordner, R. Sasaki (YITP, Kyoto)';'Fri, 25 Dec 1998 08:07:41 GMT   (22kb)';'   Universal Lax pairs of the root type with spectral parameter and independent coupling constants for twisted non-simply laced Calogero-Moser models are constructed. Together with the Lax pairs for the simply laced models and untwisted non-simply laced models presented in two previous papers, this completes the derivation of universal Lax pairs for all of the Calogero-Moser models based on root systems. As for the twisted models based on B_n, C_n and BC_nroot systems, a new type of potential term with independent coupling constants can be added without destroying integrability. They are called extended twisted models. All of the Lax pairs for the twisted models presented here are new, except for the one for the F_4 model based on the short roots. The Lax pairs for the twisted G_2 model have some novel features. Derivation of various functions, twisted and untwisted, appearing in the Lax pairs for elliptic potentials with the spectral parameter is provided. The origin of the spectral parameter is also naturally explained. The Lax pairs with spectral parameter, twisted and untwisted, for the hyperbolic, the trigonometric and the rational potential models are obtained as degenerate limits of those for the elliptic potential models.

Vilkovisky (Lebedev Institute)';'Sat, 26 Dec 1998 02:07:49 GMT   (43kb)';'   When an electrically charged source is capable of both emitting the electromagnetic waves and creating charged particles from the vacuum, its radiation gets so much amplified that only the backreaction of the vacuum makes it finite. The released energy and charge are calculated in the high-frequency approximation. The technique of expectation values is advanced and employed. '
9812235;'Spectral Geometry of Heterotic Compactifications';'David D. Song and Richard J. Szabo';'Sun, 27 Dec 1998 19:02:25 GMT   (15kb)';'   The structure of heterotic string target space compactifications is studied using the formalism of the noncommutative geometry associated with lattice vertex operator algebras. The spectral triples of the noncommutative spacetimes are constructed and used to show that the intrinsic gauge field degrees of freedom disappear in the low-energy sectors of these spacetimes. The quantum geometry is thereby determined in much the same way as for ordinary superstring target spaces. In this setting, non-abelian gauge theories on the classical spacetimes arise from the K-theory of the effective target spaces. '
9812236;'Effects of Boson-Vacuum Polarization by a Singular Magnetic Vortex';'Yu. A. Sitenko (BITP, Ukraine) and A. Yu.

The zeta-function technique is used to regularize ultraviolet divergences. The expression for the effective action is derived. It is shown that the energy density and current induced in the vacuum decrease exponentially at large distances from the vortex. The analytic properties of vacuum features as functions of the complex-valued space dimension are discussed. '
9812237;'Note on the Quantum Mechanics of M Theory';'Ofer Aharony and Tom Banks';'Mon, 28 Dec 1998 19:08:45 GMT   (17kb)';'   We observe that the existence of black holes limits the extent to which M Theory (or indeed any quantum theory of gravity) can be described by conventional quantum mechanics. Although there is no contradiction with the fundamental properties of quantum mechanics, one can prove that expectation values of Heisenberg operators at fixed times cannot exist in an ordinary asymptotic Lorentz frame. Only operators whose matrix elements between the vacuum and energy eigenstates with energy greater than the Planck scale are artificially cut off, can have conventional Green's functions. This implies a Planck scale cutoff on the possible localization of measurements in time. A similar behavior arises also in ``little string theories''. We argue that conventional quantum mechanics in light cone time is compatible with the properties of black holes if there are more than four non-compact flat dimensions, and also with the properties of ``little string theories''. We contrast these observations with what is known about M Theory in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spacetimes. '

We show that appropriate boundary terms calculated on-shell give two-point correlation functions for spin-3/2 fields of the conformal field theory on the boundary. The relation between Rarita-Schwinger field masses and conformal dimensions of corresponding operators is established. '
9812239;'Supergravity currents and linearized interactions for Matrix Theory';'Washington Taylor and Mark Van Raamsdonk';'Mon, 28 Dec 1998 22:19:34 GMT   (62kb)';'   The leading terms in the long-range interaction potential between an arbitrary pair of matrix theory objects are calculated at one-loop order. This result generalizes previous calculations by including arbitrary fermionic background field configurations. The interaction potential at orders 1/r^7 and 1/r^8 is shown to correspond precisely with the leading terms expected from linearized supergravity interactions between arbitrary objects in M-theory. General expressions for the stress tensor, membrane current and 5-brane current of an arbitrary matrix configuration are derived, including fermionic contributions. Supergravity effects which are correctly reproduced include membrane/5-brane interactions, 0-brane/6-brane interactions, supercurrent/supercurrent interactions and the spin contributions to moments of the supergravity currents. The matrix theory description of the supergravity stress tensor, membrane current and 5-brane current are used to propose an explicit formulation of matrix theory in an arbitrary background metric and 3-form field.

9812240;'Large N Elliptic Genus and AdS/CFT Correspondence';'Jan de Boer';'Tue, 29 Dec 1998 19:09:48 GMT   (17kb)';'   According to one of Maldacena's dualities, type IIB string theory on AdS_3 X S^3 X K3 is equivalent to a certain N=(4,4) superconformal field theory. In this note we compute the elliptic genus of the boundary theory in the supergravity approximation. A finite quantity is obtained once we introduce a particular exclusion principle. In the regime where the supergravity approximation is reliable, we find exact agreement with the elliptic genus of a sigma model with target space K3^N/S_N. '

Self-dual electromagnetic fields require p_1=p_2=p and provide a solution of the euclidean Einstein-Maxwell-Dirac equations with p-1 magnetic vortices in one surface and the same number of electric vortices in the other. The monopole condensate plays the role of cosmological constant. The virtual dimension of the moduli space is zero, showing that for given p_1 and p_2, the solutions are unique. '

We discuss properties of non-linear equations of motion which describe higher-spin gauge interactions for massive spin-0 and spin-1/2 matter fields in 2+1 dimensional anti-de Sitter space. The model is shown to have N=2 supersymmetry and to describe higher-spin interactions of d3 N=2 massive hypermultiplets. An integrating flow is found which reduces the full non-linear system to the free field equations via a non-local B\"acklund-Nicolai-type mapping. '

In particular, the linear analyticity equation and nonlinear covariant harmonic-field equations are studied. A covariant harmonic field can be treated as an infinite set of ordinary four-dimensional fields with higher spins. We analyze different constructions of invariant harmonic-field actions corresponding to the self-dual harmonic equations. '

Here the energy of gravitation is negative, the full energy of the system matter+gravitation is equal to zero and appeared a new process - the annihilation of matter and gravitation. As result, the cosmological constant is vanished, singularities not exist and black holes annihilated during the collaps. It is shown, that in field theories not need in mass renormalization because of automatical compensation of infinities by their own gravitational energy. The main surprise is the renormalizability of quantum gravity with negative energy of gravitational background. '

Especially, for the models with constant mass the Ohmic dissipation enlarges the range of parameters for first-order phase transitions. In the case of second-order phase transition the Ohmic dissipation suppresses the decay rate near the transition temperature(T_c). For the super-Ohmic case the dissipation yields an opposite effects to the Ohmic dissipation within exponential approximation. '
9812249;'Constrained superpotentials in harmonic gauge theories with 8';'B.M. Zupnik';'Thu, 31 Dec 1998 12:15:12 GMT   (8kb)';'   We consider D-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories with 8 supercharges (D<6,$~\cN=8$) in the framework of harmonic superspaces. The effective Abelian low-energy action for D=5 contains the free and Chern-Simons terms. Effective $\cN=8$ superfield actions for D<4 can be written in terms of the superpotentials satisfying the superfield constraints and (6-D)-dimensional Laplace equations. The role of alternative harmonic structures is discussed. '
9812250;'Integrability of the RG flows and the bulk/boundary correspondence';'A.Gorsky';'Thu, 31 Dec 1998 13:56:14 GMT   (14kb)';'   We suggest that RG flows in the N=2 SUSY YM theories are governed by the pair of the integrable systems. The main dynamical ingredient amounts from the interaction of the small size instantons with the regulator degrees of freedom. The relation with the bulk/boundary correspondence is discussed. '
9812251;'Modular Constructions of Quantum Field Theories with Interactions';'B. Schroer and H.-W. Wiesbrock (FU-Berlin, Germany)';'Thu, 31 Dec 1998 14:30:26 GMT   (23kb)';'   We extend the previously introduced constructive modular method to nonperturbative QFT. In particular the relevance of the concept of ``quantum localization'' (via intersection of algebras) versus classical locality (via support properties of test functions) is explained in detail, the wedge algebras are constructed rigorously and the formal aspects of double cone algebras for d=1+1 factorizing theories are determined. The well-known on-shell crossing symmetry of the S-Matrix and of formfactors (cyclicity relation) in such theories is intimately related to the KMS properties of new quantum-local PFG (one-particle polarization-free generators) of these wedge algebras. These generators are ``on-shell'' and their Fourier transforms turn out to fulfill the Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra. As the wedge algebras contain the crossing symmetry informations, the double cone algebras reveal the particle content of fields. Modular theory associates with this double cone algebra two very useful chiral conformal quantum field theories which are the algebraic versions of the light ray algebras. '

The proof of the no-ghost theorem is outlined, assuming a certain restriction on the representation content for bosonic and fermionic strings on SU(1,1). Some possible connections with the AdS/CFT correspondence are mentioned. (Based on invited talk by JME at Trieste Conference on Super 5-branes and Physics in (5+1)-dimensions.) '
9812253;'On the Hypermultiplet Moduli Space of Heterotic Compactifications with';'Eugene Perevalov';'Thu, 31 Dec 1998 22:42:07 GMT   (19kb)';'   We explore a relation between four-dimensional N=2 heterotic vacua induced by Mirror Symmetry via Heterotic/Type II duality. It allows us to compute the \alpha' corrections to the hypermultiplet moduli space of heterotic compactifications on K3xT^2 in the limit of large base of the elliptic K3. We concentrate on the case of point-like instantons on orbifold singularities leading to low-dimensional hypermultiplet moduli spaces. '

The curvature and the gravitation are represented as manifestations of structure of stochastic space-time, i.e. as consequences of quantum fluctuations. Einstein's equations for metric tensor represented as equations for tensor of diffusion. The energy density of such diffusional gravitation is negative defined and leads to renormalizable quantum gravity with vanishing cosmological constant. '

Hammou (SISSA, Trieste, Italy),';'Fri, 26 Feb 1999 10:47:56 GMT   (19kb)';'   We study ${\cal F}^4$-threshold corrections in an eight dimensional S-dual pair of string theories, as a prototype of dual string vacua with sixteen supercharges. We show that the orbifold CFT description of D-string instantons gives rise to a perturbative expansion similar to the one appearing on the fundamental string side. By an explicit calculation, using the Nambu-Goto action in the static gauge, we show that the first subleading term agrees precisely on the two sides. We then give a general argument to show that the agreement extends to all orders. '
9902203;'The structure of the exact effective action and the quark confinement in';'K.Stepanyantz';'Fri, 26 Feb 1999 11:29:17 GMT   (10kb)';'   An expression for the exact (nonperturbative) effective action of $N$=1 supersymmetric gauge theories is proposed, supposing, that all particles except for the gauge bosons are massive. Analysis of its form shows, that instanton effects in the supersymmetric theories can lead to the quark confinement. The typical scale of confinement in MSSM QCD, calculated from the first principles, is in agreement with the experimental data. The proposed explanation is quite different from the dual Higgs mechanism. '

9902205;'The Ruijsenaars-Schneider Model in the Context of Seiberg-Witten Theory';'H.W.Braden, A.Marshakov, A.Mironov and A.Morozov';'Fri, 26 Feb 1999 19:24:19 GMT   (21kb)';'   The compactification of five dimensional N=2 SUSY Yang-Mills (YM) theory onto a circle provides a four dimensional YM model with N=4 SUSY. This supersymmetry can be broken down to N=2 if non-trivial boundary conditions in the compact dimension, \phi(x_5 +R) = e^{2\pi i\epsilon}\phi(x_5), are imposed on half of the fields. This two-parameter (R,\epsilon) family of compactifications includes as particular limits most of the previously studied four dimensional N=2 SUSY YM models with supermultiplets in the adjoint representation of the gauge group. The finite-dimensional integrable system associated to these theories via the Seiberg-Witten construction is the generic elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider model. In particular the perturbative (weak coupling) limit is described by the trigonometric Ruijsenaars-Schneider model. '

This last effective action is shown to be related by S-duality to the D5-brane effective action. '
9902207;'Gauging of 1d-space translations for nonrelativistic point particles';'P.C. Stichel (Bielefeld, Germany)';'Fri, 26 Feb 1999 15:33:57 GMT   (6kb)';'   Gauging of space translations for nonrelativistic point particles in one dimension leads to general coordinate transformations with fixed Newtonian time. The minimal gauge invariant extension of the particle velocity requires the introduction of two gauge fields whose minimal self interaction leads to a Maxwellian term in the Lagrangean. No dilaton field is introduced. We fix the gauge such that the residual symmetry group is the Galilei group. In case of a line the two-particle reduced Lagrangean describes the motion in a Newtonian gravitational potential with strength proportional to the energy. For particles on a circle with certain initial conditions we only have a collective rotation with constant angular velocity. '
9902208;'Partially Localized Intersecting BPS Branes';'Donam Youm';'Fri, 26 Feb 1999 16:50:08 GMT   (15kb)';'   We present the explicit forms of supergravity solutions for the various intersecting two BPS branes in eleven and ten dimensions, where one brane is localized at the delocalized other brane. Our partially localized supergravity solutions describe brane configurations in the near horizon region of the delocalized branes, where the two constituent branes meet in the overall transverse space and the delocalized branes coincide. We also give the brane worldvolume interpretations for some of such supergravity solutions. '

In contrast to previously known solutions, these intersections are completely localized. We solve the equations for a particular class of configurations which in the near-horizon decoupling limit are dual to N_f = 2N_c Seiberg-Witten superconformal field theories with gauge group SU(N) and generalisations to SU(N)^n. We also discuss the relationship to D3-branes in the presence of an A_k singularity. '
9902211;'CNM Models, Holomorphic Functions and Projective Superspace C-Maps';'S. James Gates, Jr., Tristan Hubsch and Sergei M. Kuzenko';'Fri, 26 Feb 1999 18:51:27 GMT   (20kb)';'   Continuing the investigation of CNM (chiral-nonminimal) hypermultiplet nonlinear sigma-models, we propose extensions of the concept of the c-map which relate holomorphic functions to hyper-Kahler geometries. In particular, we show that a whole series of hyper-Kahler potentials can be derived by replacing the role of the 4D, N = 1 tensor multiplet in the original c-map by 4D, N = 1 non-minimal multiplets and auxiliary superfields. The resulting N = 2 models appear to have interesting connections to Calabi-Yau manifolds and algebraic varieties. These models also emphasize the fact that special hyper-Kahler manifolds (the analogs of special Kahler manifolds) without isometries exist. '
9903201;'Rotating NS5-brane solution and its exact string theoretical description';'Konstadinos Sfetsos';'Tue, 23 Mar 1999 21:34:45 GMT   (11kb)';'   We construct the most general solution in type-II string theory that represents N coincident non-extremal rotating NS5-branes and determine the relevant thermodynamic quantities. We show that in the field theory limit, it has an exact description. In particular, it can be obtained by an O(3,3) duality transformation on the exact string background for the coset model SL(2,R)_{-N}/U(1) \times SU(2)_N. In the extreme supersymmetric limit we recover the multicenter solution, with a ring singularity structure, that has been discussed recently. '

It turns out to possess a nontrivial automorphism which relates twisted chiral to twisted anti-chiral superfields and hence makes possible to construct noncommutative nonlinear $\si$-models with extended supersymmetry.

9903203;'Stress Tensors and Casimir Energies in the AdS/CFT Correspondence';'Robert C. Myers';'Tue, 23 Mar 1999 23:07:16 GMT   (22kb)';'   We discuss various approaches to extracting the full stress-energy tensor of the conformal field theory from the corresponding supergravity solutions, within the framework of the Maldacena conjecture. This provides a more refined probe of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We apply these techniques in considering the Casimir energy of the conformal field theory on a torus. It seems that either generically the corresponding supergravity solutions are singular (i.e., involve regions of large string-scale curvatures), or that they are largely insensitive to the boundary conditions of the CFT on the torus.

9903204;'Dynamical content of Chern-Simons Supergravity';'Osvaldo Chandia, Ricardo Troncoso and Jorge Zanelli';'Wed, 24 Mar 1999 02:31:21 GMT   (11kb)';'   The dynamical content of local AdS supergravity in five dimensions is discussed. The bosonic sector of the theory contains the vielbein ($e^{a}$), the spin connection ($\omega ^{ab}$) and internal SU(N) and U(1) gauge fields. The fermionic fields are complex Dirac spinors ($\psi ^{i}$) in a vector representation of SU(N). All fields together form a connection 1-form in the superalgebra SU(2,2|N). For N=4, the symplectic matrix has maximal rank in a locally AdS background in which the dynamical degrees of freedom can be identified. The resulting efective theory have different numbers of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. '
9903205;'D-branes and Deformation Quantization';'Volker Schomerus';'Wed, 24 Mar 1999 22:14:33 GMT   (13kb)';'   In this note we explain how world-volume geometries of D-branes can be reconstructed within the microscopic framework where D-branes are described through boundary conformal field theory. We extract the (non-commutative) world-volume algebras from the operator product expansions of open string vertex operators. For branes in a flat background with constant non-vanishing B-field, the operator products are computed perturbatively to all orders in the field strength. The resulting series coincides with Kontsevich's presentation of the Moyal product. After extending these considerations to fermionic fields we conclude with some remarks on the generalization of our approach to curved backgrounds. '
9903206;'The Standard Model and its Generalizations in Epstein-Glaser Approach to';'Dan Radu Grigore';'Wed, 24 Mar 1999 14:03:34 GMT   (24kb)';'   We complete our study of non-Abelian gauge theories in the framework of Epstein-Glaser approach to renormalization theory including in the model an arbitrary number of Dirac Fermions. We consider the consistency of the model up to the third order of the perturbation theory. In the second order we obtain pure group theoretical relations expressing a representation property of the numerical coefficients appearing in the left and right handed components of the interaction Lagrangian. In the third order of the perturbation theory we obtain the the condition of cancellation of the axial anomaly. '
9903207;'Monopole Dynamics in N=2 super Yang-Mills Theory From a Threebrane Probe';'Robert de Mello Koch, Alastair Paulin-Campbell and Joao P. Rodrigues';'Wed, 24 Mar 1999 15:10:28 GMT   (19kb)';'   The BPS states of N=2 super Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(2) are constructed as non-trivial finite-energy solutions of the worldvolume theory of a threebrane probe in F theory. The solutions preserve 1/2 of N=2 supersymmetry and provide a worldvolume realization of strings stretching from the probe to a sevenbrane. The positions of the sevenbranes correspond to singularities in the field theory moduli space and to curvature singularities in the supergravity background. We explicitly show how the UV cut off of the effective field theory is mapped into an IR cut off in the supergravity. Finally, we discuss some features of the moduli spaces of these solutions. '
9903208;'Universality Class of Confining Strings';'M. C. Diamantini, H. Kleinert and C. A. Trugenberger';'Wed, 24 Mar 1999 15:51:11 GMT   (10kb)';'   A recently proposed model of confining strings has a non-local world-sheet action induced by a space-time Kalb-Ramond tensor field. Here we show that, in the large-D approximation, an infinite set of ghost- and tachyon-free truncations of the derivative expansion of this action all lead to c=1 models. Their infrared limit describes smooth strings with world-sheets of Hausdorff dimension D_H=2 and long-range orientational order, as expected for QCD strings. '
9903209;'AdS_3/CFT_2 correspondence at finite temperature';'L.

Correlation functions that correspond to the bulk theory at finite temperature are obtained in the regularization a'la Gubser, Klebanov, and Polyakov. The BTZ black hole solutions in AdS_3 are T-dual to the solution in the AdS_3 space without singularity. '
9903210;'Curvature terms in D-brane actions and their M-theory origin';'C.P. Bachas, P. Bain and M.B. Green';'Wed, 24 Mar 1999 19:31:53 GMT   (31kb)';'   We derive the complete $(curvature)^2$ terms of effective D-brane actions, for arbitrary ambient geometries and world-volume embeddings, at lowest order (disk-level) in the string-loop expansion. These terms reproduce the $o(\alpha'^2)$ corrections to string scattering amplitudes, and are consistent with duality conjectures. In the particular case of the D3-brane with trivial normal bundle, considerations of $SL(2,\IZ)$ invariance lead to a complete sum of D-instanton corrections for both the parity-conserving and the parity-violating parts of the effective action. These corrections are required for the cancellation of the modular anomalies of massless modes, and are consistent with the absence of chiral anomalies in the intersection domain of pairs of D-branes. We also show that the parity-conserving part of the non-perturbative R^2 action follows from a one-loop quantum calculation in the six-dimensional world-volume of the M5-brane compactified on a two-torus.

Schmidt';'Wed, 24 Mar 1999 21:32:52 GMT   (50kb)';'   The computation of mode sums of the types encountered in basic quantum field theoretic applications is addressed with an emphasis on their expansions into functions of distance that can be interpreted as potentials. We show how to regularize and calculate the Casimir energy for the continuum Nambu-Goto string with massive ends as well as for the discrete Isgur-Paton non-relativistic string with massive ends. As an additional example, we examine the effect on the interquark potential of a constant Kalb-Ramond field strength interacting with a QCD string. '
9903212;'Seeking the Ground State of String Theory';'Michael Dine';'Thu, 25 Mar 1999 00:21:24 GMT   (21kb)';'   Recently, a number of authors have challenged the conventional assumption that the string scale, Planck mass, and unification scale are roughly comparable. It has been suggested that the string scale could be as low as a TeV. The greatest obstacle to developing a string phenomenology is our lack of understanding of the ground state. We explain why the dynamics which determines this state is not likely to be accessible to any systematic approximation. We note that the racetrack scheme, often cited as a counterexample, suffers from similar difficulties. We stress that the weakness of the gauge couplings, the gauge hierarchy, and coupling unification suggest that it may be possible to extract some information in a systematic approximation. We review the ideas of Kahler stabilization, an attempt to reconcile these facts. We consider whether the system is likely to sit at extremes of the moduli space, as in recent proposals for a low string scale. Finally we discuss the idea of Maximally Enhanced Symmetry, a hypothesis which is technically natural, compatible with basic facts about cosmology, and potentially predictive. '
9903213;'Brane Baldness vs. Superselection Sectors';'Donald Marolf and Amanda W. Peet';'Thu, 25 Mar 1999 00:10:05 GMT   (35kb)';'   The search for intersecting brane solutions in supergravity is a large and profitable industry. Recently, attention has focused on finding localized forms of known `delocalized' solutions. However, in some cases, a localized version of the delocalized solution simply does not exist. Instead, localized separated branes necessarily delocalize as the separation is removed. This phenomenon is related to black hole no-hair theorems, i.e. `baldness.' We continue the discussion of this effect and describe how it can be understood, in the case of Dirichlet branes, in terms of the corresponding intersection field theory. When it occurs, it is associated with the quantum mixing of phases and lack of superselection sectors in low dimensional field theories. We find surprisingly wide agreement between the field theory and supergravity both with respect to which examples delocalize and with respect to the rate at which this occurs. '
9903214;'Embedding AdS Black Holes in Ten and Eleven Dimensions';'M. Cvetic, M.J. Duff, P. Hoxha, James T. Liu, H. Lu, J.X. Lu, R.';'Fri, 26 Mar 1999 00:38:14 GMT   (28kb)';'   We construct the non-linear Kaluza-Klein ans\"atze describing the embeddings of the U(1)^3, U(1)^4 and U(1)^2 truncations of D=5, D=4 and D=7 gauged supergravities into the type IIB string and M-theory. These enable one to oxidise any associated lower dimensional solutions to D=10 or D=11. In particular, we use these general ans\"atze to embed the charged AdS_5, AdS_4 and AdS_7 black hole solutions in ten and eleven dimensions. The charges for the black holes with toroidal horizons may be interpreted as the angular momenta of D3-branes, M2-branes and M5-branes spinning in the tranverse dimensions, in their near-horizon decoupling limits. The horizons of the black holes coincide with the worldvolumes of the branes. The Kaluza-Klein ans\"atze also allow the black holes with spherical or hyperbolic horizons to be reinterpreted in D=10 or D=11. '
9903215;'N=2 Superconformal Field Theory with ADE Global Symmetry on a D3-brane';'Masayuki Noguchi, Seiji Terashima and Sung-Kil Yang';'Thu, 25 Mar 1999 12:09:58 GMT   (42kb)';'   We study mass deformations of N=2 superconformal field theories with ADE global symmetries on a D3-brane. The N=2 Seiberg-Witten curves with ADE symmetries are determined by the Type IIB 7-brane backgrounds which are probed by a D3-brane. The Seiberg-Witten differentials $\lambda$ for these ADE theories are constructed. We show that the poles of $\lambda$ with residues are located on the global sections of the bundle in an elliptic fibration. It is then clearly seen how the residues transform in an irreducible representation of the ADE groups. The explicit form of $\lambda$ depends on the choice of a representation of the residues. Nevertheless the physics results are identical irrespective of the representation of $\lambda$. This is considered as the global symmetry version of the universality found in N=2 Yang-Mills theory with local ADE gauge symmetries. '
9903216;'Type IIB Random Superstrings';'S.Oda and T.Yukawa';'Thu, 25 Mar 1999 13:11:23 GMT   (16kb)';'   We consider random superstrings of type IIB in $d$-dimensional space. The discretized action is constructed from the supersymetric matrix model, which has been proposed as a constructive definition of superstring theory. Our action is invariant under the local N=2 super transformations, and doesn't have any redundant fermionic degrees of freedom. '
9903217;'Space-Time and Matter in IIB Matrix Model - gauge symmetry and';'S. Iso and H. Kawai';'Thu, 25 Mar 1999 13:29:37 GMT   (19kb)';'   We pursue the study of the type IIB matrix model as a constructive definition of superstring. In this paper, we justify the interpretation of space-time as distribution of eigenvalues of the matrices by showing that some low energy excitations indeed propagate in it. In particular, we show that if the distribution consists of small clusters of size $n$, low energy theory acquires local SU(n) gauge symmetry and a plaquette action for the associated gauge boson is induced, in addition to a gauge invariant kinetic term for a massless fermion in the adjoint representation of the SU(n). We finally argue a possible identification of the diffeomorphism symmetry with permutation group acting on the set of eigenvalues, and show that the general covariance is realized in the low energy effective theory even though we do not have a manifest general covariance in the IIB matrix model action.

9903218;'Lax equations in ten dimensional supersymmetric classical Yang-Mills';'Jean-Loup Gervais';'Thu, 25 Mar 1999 13:33:56 GMT   (10kb)';'   In a recent paper (hep-th/9811108), Saveliev and the author showed that there exits an on-shell light cone gauge where the non-linear part of the field equations reduces to a (super) version of Yang's equations which may be solved by methods inspired by the ones previously developed for self-dual Yang-Mills equations in four dimensions. Here, the analogy between these latter theories and the present ones is pushed further by writing down a set of super partial linear differential equations whose consistency conditions may be derived from the SUSY Y-M equations in ten dimensions, and which are the analogues of the Lax pair of Belavin and Zakharov. On the simplest example of the two pole ansatz, it is shown that the same solution-generating techniques are at work, as for the derivation of the celebrated multi-instanton solutions carried out in the late seventies. The present Lax representation, however, is only a consequence of (instead of being equivalent to) the field equations, in contrast with the Belavin Zakharov Lax pair. '

Rno';'Thu, 25 Mar 1999 16:15:59 GMT   (16kb)';'   We make use of product integrals to provide an unambiguous mathematical representation of Wilson line and Wilson loop operators. Then, drawing upon various properties of product integrals, we discuss such properties of these operators as approximating them with partial sums, their convergence, and their behavior under gauge transformations. We also obtain a surface product integral representation for the Wilson loop operator. The result can be interpreted as the non-abelian version of Stokes theorem. '
9903222;'On Modular Invariance and 3D Gravitational Instantons';'T. Brotz, M. Ortiz, and A. Ritz';'Thu, 25 Mar 1999 16:58:17 GMT   (16kb)';'   We study the modular transformation properties of Euclidean solutions of 3D gravity whose asymptotic geometry has the topology of a torus. These solutions represent saddle points of the grand canonical partition function with an important example being the BTZ black hole, and their properties under modular transformations are inherited from the boundary conformal field theory encoding the asymptotic dynamics. Within the Chern Simons formulation, classical solutions are characterised by specific holonomies describing the wrapping of the gauge field around cycles of the torus. We find that provided these holonomies transform in an appropriate manner, there exists an associated modular invariant grand canonical partition function and that the spectrum of saddle points naturally includes a thermal bath in $AdS_3$ as discussed by Maldacena and Strominger. Indeed, certain modular transformations can naturally be described within classical bulk dynamics as mapping between different foliations with a "time" coordinate along different cycles of the asymptotic torus.

9903223;'An effective action for monopoles and knot solitons in Yang-Mills theory';'Sergei V. Shabanov (Univ. of Florida)';'Thu, 25 Mar 1999 23:43:15 GMT   (13kb)';'   By comparision with numerical results in the maximal Abelian projection of lattice Yang-Mills theory, it is argued that the nonperturbative dynamics of Yang Mills theory can be described by a set of fields that take their values in the coset space SU(2)/U(1). The Yang-Mills connection is parameterized in a special way to separate the dependence on the coset field. The coset field is then regarded as a collective variable, and a method to obtain its effective action is developed. It is argued that the physical excitations of the effective action may be knot solitons. A procedure to calculate the mass scale of knot solitons is discussed for lattice gauge theories in the maximal Abelian projection. The approach is extended to the SU(N) Yang-Mills theory. A relation between the large N limit and the monopole dominance is pointed out. '
9903224;'The D1/D5 System And Singular CFT';'Nathan Seiberg and Edward Witten';'Thu, 25 Mar 1999 21:03:40 GMT   (35kb)';'   We study the conformal field theory of the D1/D5 system compactified on X (X is T^4 or K3). It is described by a sigma model whose target space is the moduli space of instantons on X. For values of the parameters where the branes can separate, the spectrum of dimensions in the conformal field theory exhibits a continuum above a gap. This continuum leads to a pathology of the conformal field theory, which explains a variety of problems in various systems. In particular, we explain the apparent discrepancy between different methods of finding the spectrum of chiral fields at certain points in the moduli space of the system. '
9903225;'Dynamic Dilatonic Domain Walls';'H.A. Chamblin and H.S. Reall (Cambridge)';'Thu, 25 Mar 1999 21:48:16 GMT   (37kb)';'   Motivated by the ``universe as a brane'' idea, we investigate the motion of a $(D-2)$-brane (or domain wall) that couples to bulk matter. Usually one would expect the spacetime outside such a wall to be time dependent however we show that in certain cases it can be static, with consistency of the Israel equations yielding relationships between the bulk metric and matter that can be used as ans\"atze to solve the Einstein equations. As a concrete model we study a domain wall coupled to a bulk dilaton with Liouville potentials for the dilaton both in the bulk and on the wall. The bulk solutions we find are all singular but some have black hole or cosmological horizons, beyond which our solutions describe domain walls moving in time dependent bulks. A significant period of world volume inflation occurs if the potential on the wall is not too steep; in some cases the bulk also inflates (with the wall comoving) while in others the wall moves relative to a non-inflating bulk. We apply our method to obtain cosmological solutions of Ho\v{r}ava-Witten theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau space. tive to a non-inflating bulk.

9903226;'Conformal Approach to Particle Phenomenology';'P.H. Frampton and C. Vafa';'Thu, 25 Mar 1999 22:26:09 GMT   (17kb)';'   We propose the existence of a non-supersymmetric conformal field theory softly broken at the TeV scale as a new mechanism for solving the hierarchy problem. We find the imposition of conformal invariance to be very restrictive with many predictive consequences, including severe restrictions on the field content, the number of families as well as on the structure of inter-family Yukawa couplings. A large class of potentially conformal non-supersymmetric theories are considered and some general predictions are made about the existence of a rich spectrum of color and weak multiplets in the TeV range.

9903227;'Holographic description of D3-branes in flat space';'Akikazu Hashimoto';'Fri, 26 Mar 1999 00:20:33 GMT   (19kb)';'   We describe a scheme for constructing the holographic dual of the full D3-brane geometry with charge $K$ by embedding it into a large anti-de Sitter space of size $N$. Such a geometry is realized in a multi-center anti-de Sitter geometry which admits a simple field theory interpretation as $SU(N+K)$ gauge theory broken to $SU(N) \times SU(K)$. We find that the characteristic size of the D3-brane geometry is of order $(K/N)^{1/4} U^0$ where $U^0$ is the scale of the Higgs. By choosing $N$ to be much larger than $K$, the scale of the D3-brane metric can be well separated from the Higgs scale in the radial coordinate. We generalize the holographic energy-distance relation and estimate the characteristic energy scale associated with these radial scales, and find that the $E/U$ relation becomes effectively $U$ independent in the range $(K/N)^{1/2} U^0 < U < U^0$. This implies that all detailed structure of the D3-brane geometry is encoded in the fine structure of the boundary gauge theory at around the Higgs scale. '
9903228;'Negative Energy, Superluminosity and Holography';'Joseph Polchinski, Leonard Susskind and Nicolaos Toumbas';'Fri, 26 Mar 1999 00:37:59 GMT   (14kb)';'   The holographic connection between large $N$ Super Yang Mills theory and gravity in anti deSitter space requires unfamiliar behavior of the SYM theory in the limit that the curvature of the AdS geometry becomes small. The paradoxical behavior includes superluminal oscillations and negative energy density. These effects typically occur in the SYM description of events which take place far from the boundary of AdS when the signal from the event arrives at the boundary. The paradoxes can be resolved by assuming a very rich collection of hidden degrees of freedom of the SYM theory which store information but give rise to no local energy density. These degrees of freedom, called precursors, are needed to make possible sudden apparently acausal energy momentum flows. Such behavior would be impossible in classical field theory as a consequence of the positivity of the energy density. However we show that these effects are not only allowed in quantum field theory but that we can model them in free quantum field theory. '
9903229;'Misner String Entropy';'R.B. Mann';'Fri, 26 Mar 1999 01:38:21 GMT   (9kb)';'   I show that gravitational entropy can be ascribed to spacetimes containing Misner strings (the gravitational analogues of Dirac strings), even in the absence of any other event horizon (or bolt) structures. This result follows from an extension of proposals for evaluating the stress-energy of a gravitational system which are motivated by the AdS/CFT correspondence. '
9903230;'Superconformal Symmetry and Correlation Functions';'Jeong-Hyuck Park';'Fri, 26 Mar 1999 03:12:02 GMT   (39kb)';'   Four-dimensional N-extended superconformal symmetry and correlation functions of quasi-primary superfields are studied within the superspace formalism. A superconformal Killing equation is derived and its solutions are classified in terms of supertranslations, dilations, Lorentz transformations, R-symmetry transformations and special superconformal transformations. In general, due to the invariance under supertranslations and special superconformal transformations, superconformally invariant n-point functions reduce to one unspecified (n-2)-point function which must transform homogeneously under the remaining rigid transformations, i.e. dilations, Lorentz transformations and R-symmetry transformations. Based on this result, we are able to identify all the superconformal invariants and obtain the general form of n-point functions for scalar superfields. In particular, as a byproduct, a selection rule for correlation functions is derived, the existence of which in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory was previously predicted in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence. Superconformally covariant differential operators are also discussed. '

A classical background solution which preserves maximal supersymmetry is fulfilled by the geometry of AdS_2\times S^3. The physical spectrum of the fluctuations is classified according to SU(1,1|2)\times SU(2) symmetry, which has a very similar structure to that in the case of compactification on AdS_3\times S^2. '
9903232;'On the Anomalous and Global Interactions of Kodaira 7-Planes';'W. Lerche and S. Stieberger';'Fri, 26 Mar 1999 13:16:47 GMT   (104kb)';'   We review interactions between certain 7-planes which are composed out of mutually non-local (p,q) 7-branes and which correspond to specific Kodaira singularities. We discuss in particular how to compute certain moduli-dependent terms in the effective action. These do not only probe the local Chern-Simons terms on the world-volumina, but also certain global aspects of plane interactions that can be attributed to ``torsion'' (or \ZZ_N-valued) D-brane charges.

9903233;'Comments on Large N Matrix Model';'Hiroshige Kajiura, Akishi Kato, Sachiko Ogushi';'Fri, 26 Mar 1999 13:14:04 GMT   (79kb)';'   The large N Matrix model is studied with attention to the quantum fluctuations around a given diagonal background. Feynman rules are explicitly derived and their relation to those in usual Yang-Mills theory is discussed. Background D-instanton configuration is naturally identified as a discretization of momentum space of a corresponding QFT. The structure of large N divergence is also studied on the analogy of UV divergences in QFT. '
9903234;'SO(2,1) Covariant IIB Superalgebra';'Mitsuko Abe, Machiko Hatsuda, Kiyoshi Kamimura and Takashi Tokunaga';'Fri, 26 Mar 1999 14:23:32 GMT   (12kb)';'   We propose a type IIB super-Poincare algebra with SO(2,1) covariant central extension. Together with SO(2,1) and SO(9,1) generators, a SO(2,1) triplet (momenta), a Majorana-spinor doublet (supercharges) and a Rarita-Schwinger central charge generate a group, G. We consider a coset G/H where H=(SO(2) x Lorentz), and the SL(2,R) 2-form doublet is obtained by the coset construction. It is shown that U(1) connections, whose strengths are associated with 2-forms, are recognized as coordinates of the enlarged space. We suggest that this is the fundamental algebra governing the superstring theories which explains the IIB SL(2,R) duality and geometrical origin of U(1) fields. '

9903236;'The Statistical Mechanics of the Self-Gravitating Gas: Equation of State';'H. J. de Vega and N. S'anchez';'Fri, 26 Mar 1999 17:06:51 GMT   (16kb)';'   We provide a complete picture of the self-gravitating non-relativistic gas at thermal equilibrium using Monte Carlo simulations (MC), analytic mean field methods (MF) and low density expansions. The system is shown to possess an infinite volume limit, both in the canonical (CE) and in the microcanonical ensemble (MCE) when N, V \to \infty, keeping N/ V^{1/3} fixed. We {\bf compute} the equation of state (we do not assume it as is customary), the entropy, the free energy, the chemical potential, the specific heats, the compressibilities, the speed of sound and analyze their properties, signs and singularities. The MF equation of state obeys a {\bf first order} non-linear differential equation of Abel type. The MF gives an accurate picture in agreement with the MC simulations both in the CE and MCE. The inhomogeneous particle distribution in the ground state suggest a fractal distribution with Haussdorf dimension D with D slowly decreasing with increasing density, 1 \lesssim D < 3. '
9903237;'AdS/CFT and the Information Paradox';'D.A. Lowe and L. Thorlacius';'Fri, 26 Mar 1999 18:33:25 GMT   (17kb)';'   The information paradox in the quantum evolution of black holes is studied within the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The unitarity of the CFT strongly suggests that all information about an initial state that forms a black hole is returned in the Hawking radiation. The CFT dynamics implies an information retention time of order the black hole lifetime. This fact determines many qualitative properties of the non-local effects that must show up in a semi-classical effective theory in the bulk. We argue that no violations of causality are apparent to local observers, but the semi-classical theory in the bulk duplicates degrees of freedom inside and outside the event horizon. Non-local quantum effects are required to eliminate this redundancy. This leads to a breakdown of the usual classical-quantum correspondence principle in Lorentzian black hole spacetimes. '
9903238;'Surface Terms as Counterterms in the AdS/CFT Correspondence';'Roberto Emparan, Clifford V. Johnson, Robert C. Myers';'Fri, 26 Mar 1999 23:53:47 GMT   (21kb)';'   We examine the recently proposed technique of adding boundary counterterms to the gravitational action for spacetimes which are locally asymptotic to anti-de Sitter. In particular, we explicitly identify higher order counterterms, which allow us to consider spacetimes of dimensions d<=7. As the counterterms eliminate the need of ``background subtraction'' in calculating the action, we apply this technique to study examples where the appropriate background was ambiguous or unknown: topological black holes, Taub-NUT-AdS and Taub-Bolt-AdS. We also identify certain cases where the covariant counterterms fail to render the action finite, and we comment on the dual field theory interpretation of this result. In some examples, the case of vanishing cosmological constant may be recovered in a limit, which allows us to check results and resolve ambiguities in certain asymptotically flat spacetime computations in the literature.

9903239;'Finite Field Theory on Noncommutative Geometries';'S. Cho, R. Hinterding, J. Madore and H. Steinacker';'Mon, 29 Mar 1999 23:27:11 GMT   (32kb)';'   The propagator is calculated on a noncommutative version of the flat plane and the Lobachevsky plane with and without an extra (euclidean) time parameter. In agreement with the general idea of noncommutative geometry it is found that the limit when the two `points' coincide is finite and diverges only when the geometry becomes commutative. The flat 4-dimensional case is also considered. This is at the moment less interesting since there has been no curved case developed with which it can be compared. '
9903240;'Asymptotic Symmetry and the General Black Hole Solution in Ads_3 Gravity';'Yuhsuke Yoshida and Takahiro Kubota';'Sat, 27 Mar 1999 15:03:19 GMT   (15kb)';'   We describe the Brown-Henneaux asymptotic symmetry of the general black holes in the Chern-Simons gauge theory of the gauge group $SL(2;{\bf R})_L\times SL(2;{\bf R})_R$. We make it clear that the vector-like subgroup $SL(2; {\bf R})_{L+R}$ plays an essential role in describing the asymptotic symmetry consistently. We find a quite general black hole solution in the $AdS_3$ gravity theory. The solution is specified by an infinite number of conserved quantities which constitute a family of mapping from $S^1$ to the gauge group. The BTZ black hole is one of the simplest case. '
9903241;'AdS Superalgebras with Brane Charges';'S. Ferrara and M. Porrati';'Mon, 29 Mar 1999 16:52:16 GMT   (8kb)';'   We consider the inclusion of brane charges in AdS_5 superalgebras that contain the maximal central extension of the super-Poincar\'e algebra on the boundary of AdS_5. For theories with N supersymmetries on the boundary, the maximal extension is OSp(1/8N,R), which contains the group $Sp(8N,R)\supset U(2N,2N) \supset SU(2,2)\times U(N)$ as extension of the conformal group. An ``intermediate'' extension to U(2N,2N/1) is also discussed, as well as the inclusion of brane charges in AdS_7 and AdS_4 superalgebras. BPS conditions in the presence of brane charges are studied in some details. '

We specifically discuss the case of theories with (hidden) global SO(2n) symmetry, from three to six dimensions. We analyze mirror symmetry for three dimensional N=4 gauge theories, Brane Box Models and six-dimensional gauge theories. We also discuss the issue of T-duality for D_n space-time singularities. Stuck D branes on ON^0 planes play an interesting role. '
9903243;'Implications of decoupling effects for one-loop corrected effective';'I.L. Buchbinder, M. Cvetic, A. Yu. Petrov';'Mon, 29 Mar 1999 23:02:36 GMT   (10kb)';'   We study the decoupling effects in one-loop corrected N=1 supersymmetric theory with gauge neutral chiral superfields, by calculating the one-loop corrected effective Lagrangian that involves light and heavy fields with the mass scale M, and subsequently eliminating heavy fields by their equations of motion. In addition to new non-renormalizable couplings, we determine the terms that grow as log(M) and renormalize the fields and couplings in the effective field theory, in accordance with the decoupling theorem. However, in a theory derived from superstring theory, these terms can significantly modify low energy predictions for the effective couplings of light fields. For example, in a class of heterotic superstring vacua with an anomalous U(1) the vacuum restabilization introduces such decoupling effects which in turn correct the low energy predictions for certain couplings by 10-50%.

9903244;'Notes on black holes and three dimensional gravity';'Maximo Banados';'Sun, 28 Mar 1999 18:20:13 GMT   (19kb)';'   These notes are the written version of two lectures delivered at the VIII Mexican School on Particles and Fields on November 1998. The level of the notes is basic assuming only some knowledge on Statistical Mechanics, General Relativity and Yang-Mills theory. After a brief introduction to the classical and semiclassical aspects of black holes, we review some relevant results on 2+1 quantum gravity. These include the Chern-Simons formulation and its affine Kac-Moody algebra, the asymptotic algebra of Brown and Henneaux, and the statistical mechanics description of 2+1 black holes. Hopefully, this contribution will be complementary with the review paper hep-th/9901148 by the same author, and perhaps, a shortcut to some recent developments in three dimensional gravity. '

Guendelman (Ben-Gurion Univ., Beer-Sheva), Emil Nissimov';'Sun, 28 Mar 1999 20:09:11 GMT   (9kb)';'   We describe new theories of composite vector and tensor (p-form) gauge fields made out of zero-dimensional constituent scalar fields (``primitives''). The local gauge symmetry is replaced by an infinite-dimensional global Noether symmetry -- the group of volume-preserving (symplectic) diffeomorphisms of the target space of the scalar primitives. We find additional non-Maxwell and non-Kalb-Ramond solutions describing topologically massive tensor gauge field configurations in odd space-time dimensions. Generalization to the supersymmetric case is also sketched. '
9903246;'Thermodynamic Partition Function of Matrix Superstrings';'G. Grignani and G. W. Semenoff';'Mon, 29 Mar 1999 17:32:10 GMT   (24kb)';'   We show that, in the limit of zero string coupling, $g_s \to 0$, the thermodynamic partition function of matrix string theory is identical to that of the finite temperature, discrete light-cone quantised (DLCQ) type IIA superstring. We discuss how the superstring is recovered in the decompactified $R^+\to\infty$ limit. '
9903247;'Fermion Determinant Calculus';'H. Kikuchi (Ohu University)';'Mon, 29 Mar 1999 10:37:32 GMT   (10kb)';'   The path-integral of the fermionic oscillator with a time-dependent frequency is analyzed. We give the exact relation between the boundary condition to define the domain in which the path-integral is performed and the transition amplitude that the path-integral calculates. According to this relation, the amplitude suppressed by a zero mode does not indicate any special dynamics, unlike the analogous situation in field theories. It simply says the path-integral picks up a combination of the amplitudes that vanishes. The zero mode that is often neglected in the reason of not being normalizable is necessary to obtain the correct answer for the propagator and to avoid an anomaly on the fermion number. We give a method to obtain the fermionic determinant by the determinant of a simple (2\times 2) matrix, which enables us to calculate it for a variety of boundary conditions. '
9903248;'Virasoro Orbits, AdS_3 Quantum Gravity and Entropy';'J.Navarro-Salas, P.Navarro';'Mon, 29 Mar 1999 14:05:46 GMT   (9kb)';'   We analyse the canonical structure of AdS_3 gravity in terms of the coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro group. There is one subset of orbits, associated to BTZ black hole solutions, that can be described by a pair of chiral free fields with a background charge. There is also a second subset of orbits, associated to point-particle solutions, that are described by two pairs of chiral free fields obeying a constraint. All these orbits admit K\"ahler quantization and generate a Hilbert space which, despite of having $\Delta_0(\bar{\Delta}_0)=0$, does not provide the right degeneracy to account for the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy due to the breakdown of modular invariance. Therefore, additional degrees of freedom, reestablishing modular invariance, are necessarily required to properly account for the black hole entropy. '
9903249;'Using the Hopf Algebra Structure of QFT in Calculations';'D.Kreimer, R.Delbourgo';'Tue, 30 Mar 1999 09:52:32 GMT   (165kb)';'   We employ the recently discovered Hopf algebra structure underlying perturbative Quantum Field Theory to derive iterated integral representations for Feynman diagrams. We give two applications: to massless Yukawa theory and quantum electrodynamics in four dimensions. '
9903251;'Infrared region of QCD and confining strings';'R.Parthasarathy';'Tue, 30 Mar 1999 11:32:19 GMT   (13kb)';'   Gauge field configurations appropriate for the infrared region of QCD are proposed in a submanifold of $su(3)$. Some properties of the submanifold are presented. Using the usual action for QCD, in the absense of quarks, confinement of these configurations is realized as in the London theory of Meissner effect. Choosing a representation for the monopole field strength, a string action corresponding to the effective gauge theory action in the infrared region, is obtained. This confining string action contains the Nambu-Goto term, extrinsic curvature action and the Euler characteristic of the string world sheet. '
9903252;'Seiberg-Witten Curves and Integrable Systems';'A.Marshakov';'Tue, 30 Mar 1999 14:07:44 GMT   (25kb)';'   This talk gives an introduction into the subject of Seiberg-Witten curves and their relation to integrable systems.

9903253;'Chiral symmetry breaking as a consequence of nontrivial spatial topology';'Yurii A. Sitenko';'Tue, 30 Mar 1999 20:25:41 GMT   (8kb)';'   A singular configuration of external static magnetic field in the form of a pointlike vortex polarizes the vacuum of quantized massless spinor field in 2+1-dimensional space-time. This results in an analogue of the Bohm-Aharonov effect: the chiral symmetry breaking condensate, energy density and current emerge in the vacuum even in the case when the spatial region of nonvanishing external field strength is excluded. The dependence of the vacuum characteristics both on the value of the vortex flux and on the choice of the boundary condition at the location of the vortex is determined. '
9903254;'Phase-space Quantization of Field Theory';'Cosmas Zachos and Thomas Curtright';'Tue, 30 Mar 1999 15:29:04 GMT   (129kb)';'   In this lecture, a limited introduction of gauge invariance in phase-space is provided, predicated on canonical transformations in quantum phase-space. Exact characteristic trajectories are also specified for the time-propagating Wigner phase-space distribution function: they are especially simple - indeed, classical - for the quantized simple harmonic oscillator. This serves as the underpinning of the field theoretic Wigner functional formulation introduced. Scalar field theory is thus reformulated in terms of distributions in field phase-space. This is a pedagogical selection from work published in J Phys A32 (1999) 771 and Phys Rev D58 (1998) 025002, reported at the Yukawa Institute Workshop "Gauge Theory and Integrable Models", 26-29 January, 1999.

Usually we think of Dirac's negative energy sea as an unphysical construct, invented to render quantum field theory physically acceptable by hiding the negative energy solutions. I suggest that in fact physical consequences can be drawn from Dirac's construction. '
9903256;'Remarks on the Atiyah-Hitchin metric';'Ioannis Bakas';'Tue, 30 Mar 1999 17:53:33 GMT   (11kb)';'   We outline the construction of the Atiyah-Hitchin metric on the moduli space of SU(2) BPS monopoles with charge 2, first as an algebraic curve in C^3 following Donaldson and then as a solution of the Toda field equations in the continual large N limit. We adopt twistor methods to solve the underlying uniformization problem, which by the generalized Legendre transformation yield the Kahler coordinates and the Kahler potential of the metric. We also comment on the connection between twistors and the Seiberg-Witten construction of quantum moduli spaces, as they arise in three dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories, and briefly address the uniformization of algebraic curves in C^3 in the context of large N Toda theory. (Based on talks delivered in September 1998 at the 32nd International Symposium Ahrenshoop on the Theory of Elementary Particles, Buckow; the 21st Triangular Meeting on Quantum Field Theory, Crete and the TMR meeting on Quantum Aspects of Gauge Theories, Supersymmetry and Unification, Corfu; to be published in the proceedings in Fortschritte der Physik.)

9903257;'Three Dimensional Black Hole Coupled to the Born-Infeld Electrodynamics';'Mauricio Cataldo, Alberto Garcia';'Tue, 30 Mar 1999 17:59:35 GMT   (19kb)';'   A nonlinear charged version of the (2+1)-anti de Sitter black hole solution is derived. The source to the Einstein equations is a Born-Infeld electromagnetic field, which in the weak field limit becomes the (2+1)-Maxwell field. The obtained Einstein-Born-Infeld solution for certain range of the parameters (mass, charge, cosmological and Born-Infeld constants) represent a static circularly symmetric black hole. Although the covariant metric components and the electric field do not exhibit a singular behavior at r=0 the curvature invariants are singular at that point. '
9903258;'Understanding Radiatively Induced Lorentz-CPT Violation in Differential';'W.F. Chen (University of Winnipeg)';'Tue, 30 Mar 1999 18:00:48 GMT   (11kb)';'   We have investigated the perturbative ambiguity of the radiatively induced Chern-Simons term in differential regularization. The result obtained in this method contains all those obtained in other regularization schemes and the ambiguity is explicitly characterized by an indefinite ratio of two renormalization scales. It is argued that the ambiguity can only be eliminated by either imposing a physical requirement or resorting to a more fundamental principle. Some calculation techniques in coordinate space are developed in the appendices. '
9903259;'Three-dimensional Black Holes and Liouville Field Theory';'T. Nakatsu, H. Umetsu and N. Yokoi';'Tue, 30 Mar 1999 18:05:33 GMT   (24kb)';'   A quantization of (2+1)-dimensional gravity with negative cosmological constant is presented and quantum aspects of the (2+1)-dimensional black holes are studied thereby. The quantization consists of two procedures. One is related with quantization of the asymptotic Virasoro symmetry. A notion of the Virasoro deformation of 3-geometry is introduced. For a given black hole, the deformation of the exterior of the outer horizon is identified with a product of appropriate coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro groups $\hat{diff S^1}_{\pm}$. Its quantization provides unitary irreducible representations of the Virasoro algebra, in which state of the black hole becomes primary. To make the quantization complete, holonomies, the global degrees of freedom, are taken into account. By an identification of these topological operators with zero modes of the Liouville field, the aforementioned unitary representations reveal, as far as $c \gg 1$, as the Hilbert space of this two-dimensional conformal field theory. This conformal field theory, living on the cylinder at infinity of the black hole and having continuous spectrums, can recognize the outer horizon only as a it one-dimensional object in $SL_2({\bf R})$ and realize it as insertions of the corresponding vertex operator. Therefore it can not be a conformal field theory on the horizon. Two possible descriptions of the horizon conformal field theory are proposed. '
9903260;'A Note on Higher Dimensional Instantons and Supersymmetric Cycles';'H. Kanno';'Wed, 31 Mar 1999 08:23:23 GMT   (12kb)';'   We discuss instantons in dimensions higher than four. A generalized self-dual or anti-self-dual instanton equation in n-dimensions can be defined in terms of a closed (n-4) form $\Omega$ and it was recently employed as a topological gauge fixing condition in higher dimensional generalizations of cohomological Yang-Mills theory. When $\Omega$ is a calibration which is naturally introduced on the manifold of special holomony, we argue that higher dimensional instanton may be locally characterized as a family of four dimensional instantons over a supersymmetric (n-4) cycle $\Sigma$ with respect to the calibration $\Omega$. This is an instanton configuration on the total space of the normal bundle $N(\Sigma)$ of the submanifold $\Sigma$ and regarded as a natural generalization of point-like instanton in four dimensions that plays a distinguished role in a compactification of instanton moduli space.

It is found that moduli which are frozen in the absence of gravity, parametrizing the lump's width and internal orientation, may vary once gravitational effects are included. If gravitational coupling is sufficiently strong, the presence of the lump shrinks physical space to finite volume, and the moduli determining the boundary value of the CP^1 field thaw also. Explicit formulae for the metric on M_1 are found in both the weak and strong coupling regimes. The geodesic problem for weak coupling is studied in detail, and it is shown that M_1 is geodesically incomplete. This leads to the prediction that self-gravitating lumps are unstable. '
9903265;'Can the Red Shift be a consequence of the Dilaton field?';'Alejandro Cabo and Alexis Amezaga';'Thu, 1 Apr 1999 00:13:50 GMT   (7kb)';'   The possibility that the expansion rate of the Universe, as reflected by the Red Shift, could be produced by the existence of the dilaton field is explored. The analysis starts from previously studied solutions of the Einstein equations for gravity interacting with a massive scalar field. It is firstly underlined that such solutions can produce the observed values of the Hubble constant. Since the Einstein-Klein-Gordon lagrangian could be expected to appear as an effective one for the dilaton in some approximation, the mentioned solutions are applied to study this field. Therefore, the vacuum expectation value for the dilaton is selected to be of the order of the Planck mass, as it is frequently fixed in string phenomenology. Then, it follows that the value of its effective mass should be as low as m=3.9 10^(-29) cm^(-1) in order produce the observed expansion rate. The discussion can also predict a radius of the Universe of the order of 10^(29) cm. Finally, after adopting the view advanced ina previous work, in which these mentioned solutions are associated to interior configurations of collapsed scalar fields, a picture of our Universe as a black hole interior is suggested.

9903268;'Superstrings, Unifications and dualities';'Joseph Kouneiher';'Wed, 31 Mar 1999 21:32:54 GMT   (44kb)';'   I describe our understanding of physics near the planck length, in particular the great progress of the last four years in string theory. Superstring theory, and a recent extension called M theory, are leading candidates for a quantum theory that unifies gravity with the other forces. As such, they are certainly not ordinary quantum field theories. However, recent duality conjectures suggest that a more complete definition of these theories can be provided by the large N limits of suitably chosen U(N) gauge theories associated to the asymptotic boundary of spacetime.

9903269;'Black holes and membranes in AdS_7';'James T. Liu and Ruben Minasian';'Wed, 31 Mar 1999 22:57:38 GMT   (14kb)';'   We investigate maximal gauged supergravity in seven dimensions and some of its solitonic solutions. By focusing on a truncation of the gauged SO(5) R-symmetry group to its U(1)^2 Cartan subgroup, we construct general two charge black holes that are asymptotically anti-de Sitter. We demonstrate that 1- and 2-charge black holes preserve 1/2 and 1/4 of the supersymmetries respectively. Additionally, we examine the odd-dimensional self-duality equation governing the three-form potential transforming as the 5 of SO(5), and provide some insight on the construction of membrane solutions in anti-de Sitter backgrounds.

9904201;'The confining branch of QCD';'Marco Bochicchio';'Wed, 28 Apr 1999 23:39:50 GMT   (7kb)';'   We show that, as a consequence of a physical interpretation based on the Abelian projection and on the QCD string, four-dimensional QCD confines the electric flux if and only if the functional integral in the fiberwise-dual variables admits a hyper-Kahler reduction under the action of the gauge group.

9904202;'A Canonical Decomposition in Collective and Relative Variables of a';'L. Lusanna, M. Materassi';'Thu, 29 Apr 1999 09:15:20 GMT   (58kb)';'   The canonical decomposition of a real Klein-Gordon field in collective and relative variables proposed by Longhi and Materassi is reformulated on spacelike hypersurfaces. This allows to obtain the complete canonical reduction of the system on Wigner hyperplanes, namely in the rest-frame Wigner-covariant instant form of dynamics. From the study of Dixon's multipoles for the energy-momentum tensor on the Wigner hyperplanes we derive the definition of the canonical center-of-mass variable for a Klein-Gordon field configuration: it turns out that the Longhi-Materassi global variable should be interpreted as a center of phase of the field configuration. A detailed study of the kinematical "external" and "internal" properties of the field configuration on the Wigner hyperplanes is done. The construction is then extended to charged Klein-Gordon fields: the centers of phase of the two real components can be combined to define a global center of phase and a collective relative variable describing the action-reaction between the two Feshbach-Villars components of the field with definite sign of energy and charge. The Dixon multipoles for both the energy-momentum and the electromagnetic current are given. Also the coupling of the Klein-Gordon field to scalar relativistic particles is studied and it is shown that in the reduced phase space, besides the particle and field relative variables, there is also a collective relative variable describing the relative motion of the particle subsytem with respect to the field one.

The complete correspondence between these models and self dual field theoretical models in odd dimensions is established.

This model is equivalent to 2D gravity coupled to topological matter. Using techniques of the algebraic renormalization program we show that this model is anomaly free and ultraviolet as well as infrared finite at all orders of perturbation theory. '

9904207;'Non-BPS States and Branes in String Theory';'Ashoke Sen';'Thu, 29 Apr 1999 13:54:52 GMT   (40kb)';'   We review the recent developments in our understanding of non-BPS states and branes in string theory. The topics include 1) construction of unstable non-BPS D-branes in type IIA and type IIB string theories, 2) construction of stable non-BPS D-branes on various orbifolds and orientifolds of type II string theories, 3) description of BPS and non-BPS D-branes as tachyonic soliton solutions on brane-antibrane pair of higher dimension, and 4) study of the spectrum of non-BPS states and branes on a system of coincident D-brane - orientifold plane system. Some other related results are also discussed briefly. '

Kudryavtsev';'Thu, 29 Apr 1999 14:54:00 GMT   (35kb)';'   The process of collision of two parallel domain walls in a supersymmetric model is studied both in effective Lagrangian approximation and by numerical solving of the exact classical field problem. For small initial velocities we find that the walls interaction looks like elastic reflection with some delay. It is also shown that in such approximation internal parameter of the wall may be considered as a time-dependent dynamical variable. '
9904210;'Confining N=1 SUSY gauge theories from Seiberg duality';'Matthias Klein';'Thu, 29 Apr 1999 19:43:36 GMT   (34kb)';'   In this talk I review and generalize an idea of Seiberg that an N=1 supersymmetric gauge theory shows confinement without breaking of chiral symmetry when the gauge symmetry of its magnetic dual is completely broken by the Higgs effect. It is shown how the confining spectrum of a supersymmetric gauge theory can easily be derived when a magnetic dual is known and this method is applied to many models containing fields in second rank tensor representations and an appropriate tree-level superpotential.

9904211;'Type I on (Generalized) Voisin-Borcea Orbifolds and Non-perturbative';'Zurab Kakushadze';'Thu, 29 Apr 1999 20:08:28 GMT   (39kb)';'   We consider non-perturbative four dimensional N=1 space-time supersymmetric orientifolds corresponding to Type I compactifications on (generalized) Voisin-Borcea orbifolds. Some states in such compactifications arise in ``twisted'' open string sectors which lack world-sheet description in terms of D-branes. Using Type I-heterotic duality as well as the map between Type IIB orientifolds and F-theory we are able to obtain the massless spectra of such orientifolds. The four dimensional compactifications we discuss in this context are examples of chiral N=1 supersymmetric string vacua which are non-perturbative from both orientifold and heterotic points of view. In particular, they contain both D9- and D5-branes as well as non-perturbative ``twisted'' open string sector states. We also explain the origins of various inconsistencies arising in such compactifications for certain choices of the gauge bundle. '

9904213;'Dual Supersymmetry Algebras from Partial Supersymmetry Breaking';'R. Altendorfer and J.

Each of the representations can be ``unHiggsed'', which gives rise to a set of dual N=2 supergravities and supersymmetry algebras. '
9904214;'Towards exact results of QED from supersymmetry';'Masato Arai and Noriaki Kitazawa';'Fri, 30 Apr 1999 07:15:48 GMT   (62kb)';'   To obtain some exact results of U(1) gauge theory (QED), we construct the low energy effective action of N=2 supersymmetric QED with a massless matter and Fayet-Iliopoulos term, assuming no confinement. The harmonic superspace formalism for N=2 extended supersymmetry makes the construction easy. We analyze the vacuum structure and find no vacuum. It suggests the confinement in non-supersymmetric QED at low energies. '

Dept.,';'Fri, 30 Apr 1999 14:27:35 GMT   (16kb)';'   We propose and develop a new calculus for local variational differential operators. The main difference of the new formalism with the canonical differential calculus is that the image of higher order operators on local functionals does not contain indefinite quantities like $\delta(0)$. We apply this formalism to BV formulation of general gauge field theory and to its Sp(2)-symmetric generalization. Its relation to a quasiclassical expansion is also discussed. '

We find the SO(8) theory previously found by compactification of 10D on $K3$. We also find eleven $G_2\times G_2$ theories, two with symmetric matter content. It is not obvious how ten of the $G_2\times G_2$ theories can be gotten from 10D. '
9904217;'Calabi-Yau black holes and (0,4) sigma models';'Ruben Minasian, Gregory Moore and Dimitrios Tsimpis';'Fri, 30 Apr 1999 17:08:18 GMT   (40kb)';'   When an M-theory fivebrane wraps a holomorphic surface $\CP$ in a Calabi-Yau 3-fold $X$ the low energy dynamics is that of a black string in 5 dimensional $\CN=1$ supergravity. The infrared dynamics on the string worldsheet is an $\CN = (0,4)$ 2D conformal field theory. Assuming the 2D CFT can be described as a nonlinear sigma model, we describe the target space geometry of this model in terms of the data of $X$ and $\CP$. Variations of weight two Hodge structures enter the construction of the model in an interesting way. '
9904218;'On the twisted chiral potential in 2d and the analogue of rigid special';'Peter Kaste';'Fri, 30 Apr 1999 17:56:08 GMT   (17kb)';'   We discuss how to obtain an N=(2,2) supersymmetric SU(3) gauge theory in two dimensions via geometric engineering from a Calabi-Yau 4-fold and compute its non-perturbative twisted chiral potential. The relevant compact part of the 4-fold geometry consists of two intersecting P^1's fibered over P^2. The rigid limit of the local mirror of this geometry is a complex surface that generalizes the Seiberg-Witten curve and on which there exist two holomorphic 2-forms. These stem from the same meromorphic 2-form as derivatives w.r.t. the two moduli, respectively. The middle periods of this meromorphic form give directly the twisted chiral potential. The explicit computation of these and of the four-point Yukawa couplings allows for a non-trivial test of the analogue of rigid special geometry for a 4-fold with several moduli. '
9905201;'Gauge invariance of the one-loop effective action of the Higgs field in';'J. Baacke and K. Heitmann';'Thu, 27 May 1999 09:13:32 GMT   (13kb)';'   The one-loop effective action of the abelian and nonabelian Higgs models has been studied in various gauges, in the context of instanton and sphaleron transition, bubble nucleation and most recently in nonequilibrium dynamics. Gauge invariance is expected on account of Nielsen' s theorem, if the classical background field is an extremum of the classical action, i.e., a solution of the classical equation of motion. We substantiate this general statement for the one-loop effective action, as computed using mode functions. We show that in the gauge-Higgs sector there are two types of modes that satisfy the same equation of motion as the Faddeev-Popov modes. We apply the general analysis to the computation of the fluctuation determinant for bubble nucleation in the SU(2) Higgs model in the 't Hooft gauge with general gauge parameter $\xi$. We show that due to the cancellation of the modes mentioned above the fluctuation determinant is independent of $\xi$. '

The topological solitons in the model has energy,charge,flux and angular momentum quantised in each topological sector. '

Based on previous work [hep-th/9608070], the numerical procedure is refined further and applied to several examples. We provide numerical evidence that repulsive potentials lead to positive contributions to the vacuum energy. Furthermore, the crucial role played by bound-states is clearly seen. '
9905205;'Thermodynamics of Large-N Super Yang-Mills Theory and AdS/CFT';'Chanju Kim and Soo-Jong Rey';'Thu, 27 May 1999 15:12:34 GMT   (174kb)';'   Thermodynamics of d=4, N=4 supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills theory is studied with particular attention on perturbative expansion at weak `t Hooft coupling regime and interpolation to strong coupling regime thereof. Non-ideal gas effect to free-energy is calculated and found that leading- and next-to-leading-order corrections contribute with relative opposite sign. Pade approximant method is adopted to improve fixed-order, perturbative series and is found to decrease free-energy monotonically as `t Hooft coupling parameter is increased. This may be regarded as an indication of smooth interpolation of thermodynamics between weak and strong `t Hooft coupling regimes, as suggested by Maldacena's AdS/CFT correspondence. '

Numerical results for the critical exponent nu in three dimensions are calculated by means of a truncated series expansion of the blocked potential. We demonstrate how the convergence of nu as a function of the order of truncation can be improved through a fine tuning of the smoothness of the smearing functions. '

These are used, first, to prove the equivalence of the thermodynamic and the hydrodynamic pressure in equilibrium in the presence of the trace anomaly, closing a gap in previous arguments. Second, in the temporal axial gauge a formula is derived which expresses the thermal pressure in terms of a Dyson-resummed two-point function. This overcomes the infrared problems encountered in the conventional perturbation-theory approach. '
9905208;'Dual Confinement of Grand Unified Monopoles?';'Alfred Scharff Goldhaber';'Thu, 27 May 1999 17:31:37 GMT   (16kb)';'   A simple formal computation, and a variation on an old thought experiment, both indicate that QCD with light quarks may confine fundamental color magnetic charges, giving an explicit as well as elegant resolution to the `global color' paradox, strengthening Vachaspati's SU(5) electric-magnetic duality, opening new lines of inquiry for monopoles in cosmology, and suggesting a class of geometrically large QCD excitations -- loops of Z(3) color magnetic flux entwined with light-quark current. The proposal may be directly testable in lattice gauge theory or supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Recent results in deeply-inelastic electron scattering, and future experiments both there and in high-energy collisions of nuclei, could give evidence on the existence of Z(3) loops. If confirmed, they would represent a consistent realization of the bold concept underlying the Slansky-Goldman-Shaw `glow' model -- phenomena besides standard meson-baryon physics manifest at long distance scales -- but without that model's isolable fractional electric charges.

9905209;'Summing the Instanton Series in N=2 Superconformal Large-N QCD';'Timothy J. Hollowood, Valentin V. Khoze and Michael P. Mattis';'Thu, 27 May 1999 18:26:41 GMT   (13kb)';'   We consider the multi-instanton collective coordinate integration measure in N=2 supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theory with N_F fundamental hypermultiplets. In the large-N limit, at the superconformal point where N_F=2N and all VEVs are turned off, the k-instanton moduli space collapses to a single copy of AdS_5*S^1. The resulting k-instanton effective measure is proportional to N^{1/2} g^4 Z_k^(6), where Z_k^(6) is the partition function of N=(1,0) SYM theory in six dimensions reduced to zero dimensions. The multi-instanton can in fact be summed in closed form. As a hint of an AdS/CFT duality, with the usual relation between the gauge theory and string theory parameters, this precisely matches the normalization of the charge-k D-instanton measure in type IIB string theory compactified to six dimensions on K3 with a vanishing two-cycle.

9905210;'Bent Domain Walls as Braneworlds';'Nemanja Kaloper';'Thu, 27 May 1999 23:02:53 GMT   (25kb)';'   We consider domain walls embedded in curved backgrounds as an approximation for braneworld scenarios. We give a large class of new exact solutions, exhausting the possibilities for describing one and two walls for the cases where the curvature of both the bulk and the wall is locally constant. In the case of two walls, we find solutions where each wall has positive tension. An interesting property of these solutions is that the curvature of the walls can be much smaller than the tension, leading to a significant cancellation of the effective cosmological constant, which however is still much larger than the observational limits. We further discuss some aspects of inflation in models based on wall solutions. '
9905211;'Holography for Coset Spaces';'Ruth Britto-Pacumio, Andrew Strominger and Anastasia Volovich';'Thu, 27 May 1999 19:18:17 GMT   (19kb)';'   M/string theory on noncompact, negatively curved, cosets which generalize $AdS_{D+1}=SO(D,2)/SO(D,1)$ is considered. Holographic descriptions in terms of a conformal field theory on the boundary of the spacetime are proposed. Examples include $SU(2,1)/U(2)$, which is a Euclidean signature (4,0) space with no supersymmetry, and $SO(2,2)/SO(2)$ and $SO(3,2)/SO(3)$, which are Lorentzian signature (4,1) and (6,1) spaces with eight supersymmetries. Qualitatively new features arise due to the degenerate nature of the conformal boundary metric. '

Kielanowski';'Thu, 27 May 1999 21:18:00 GMT   (14kb)';'   Motivated by the debate of possible definitions of mass and width of resonances for $Z$-boson and hadrons, we suggest a definition of unstable particles by ``minimally complex'' semigroup representations of the Poincar\'e group characterized by $(j,{\mathsf s}=(m-i\Gamma/2)^{2})$ in which the Lorentz subgroup is unitary. This definition, though decidedly distinct from those based on various renormalization schemes of perturbation theory, is intimately connected with the first order pole definition of the $S$-matrix theory in that the complex square mass $(m-i\Gamma/2)^{2}$ characterizing the representation of the Poincar\'e semigroup is exactly the position ${\mathsf s}_R$ at which the $S$-matrix has a simple pole. Wigner's representations $(j,m)$ are the limit case of the complex representations for $\Gamma=0$. These representations have generalized vectors (Gamow kets) which have, in addition to the $S$-matrix pole at ${\mathsf s}=(m-i\Gamma/2)^{2}$, all the other properties that heuristically the unstable states need to possess: a Breit-Wigner distribution in invariant square mass and a lifetime $\tau=\frac{1}{\Gamma}$ defined by the exactly exponential law for the decay probability ${\cal P}(t)$ and rate $\dot{\cal P}(t)$ given by an exact Golden Rule which becomes Dirac's Golden Rule in the Born-approximation. In addition and unintended, they have an asymmetric time evolution. '
9905214;'Integrable Marginal Points in the N-Cosine Model';'Bogomil Gerganov';'Thu, 27 May 1999 23:33:40 GMT   (18kb)';'   The integrability of the N-cosine model, a N-field generalization of the sine-Gordon model, is investigated. We establish to first order in conformal perturbation theory that, for arbitrary N, the model possesses a quantum conserved current of Lorentz spin 3 on a submanifold of the parameter space where the interaction becomes marginal. The integrability of the model on this submanifold is further studied using renormalization techniques. It is shown that for N = 2, 3, and 4 there exist special points on the marginal manifold at which the N-cosine model is equivalent to models of Gross-Neveu type and therefore is integrable. In the 2-field case we further argue that the points mentioned above exhaust all integrable cases on the marginal submanifold. '

We show that there exist solutions preserving one quarter of the underlying supersymmetry -- a single Hermitian supercharge. We derive a BPS bound for the masses of these solutions and construct a solution explicitly in a special case. The relevance to the confining phase of N=1 SUSY Yang-Mills and the M-theory/SYM relationship is discussed. '
9905218;'Duality Invariant Born-Infeld Theory';'Daniel Brace, Bogdan Morariu, Bruno Zumino';'Sat, 29 May 1999 19:18:48 GMT   (7kb)';'   We present an Sp(2n,R) duality invariant Born-Infeld U(1)^2n gauge theory with scalar fields. To implement this duality we had to introduce complex gauge fields and as a result the rank of the duality group is only half as large as that of the corresponding Maxwell gauge theory with the same number of gauge fields. The latter is self-dual under Sp(4n,R), the largest allowed duality group. A special case appears for n=1 when one can also write an SL(2,R) duality invariant Born-Infeld theory with a real gauge field. We also describe the supersymmetric version of the above construction.

It is argued that the phenomenon of self-thermalization in non-linear (chaotic) systems can be invoked to explain how the boundary theory, initially at zero temperature self thermalizes and acquires a finite temperature. Yang-Mills theory is known to be chaotic (classically) and the imaginary part of the gluon self-energy (damping rate of the gluon plasma) is expected to give the Lyapunov exponent. We explain how the imaginary part would arise in the corresponding supergravity calculation due to absorption at the horizon of the black hole. '
9905220;'Black hole entropy from Poisson brackets (demystification of some';'Vladimir O. Soloviev';'Sun, 30 May 1999 13:25:09 GMT   (8kb)';'   Recently it has been suggested by S. Carlip that black hole entropy can be derived from a central charge of the Virasoro algebra arising as a subalgebra in the surface deformations of General Relativity in any dimension. Here it is shown that the argumentation given in Section 2 of hep-th/9812013 and based on the Regge-Teitelboim approach is unsatisfactory. The functionals used are really ``non-differentiable'' under required variations and also the standard Poisson brackets for these functionals are exactly zero so being unable to get any Virasoro algebra with a central charge. Nevertheless Carlip's calculations will be correct if we admit another definition for the Poisson bracket. This new Poisson bracket differs from the standard one in surface terms only and allows to work with ``non-differentiable'' functionals. '
9905221;'Fermion-boson duality in integrable quantum field theory';'P. Baseilhac, V. A. Fateev';'Sun, 30 May 1999 14:08:26 GMT   (11kb)';'   We introduce and study one parameter family of integrable quantum field theories. This family has a Lagrangian description in terms of massive Thirring fermions $\psi,\psi^{\dagger}$ and charged bosons $\chi,\bar{\chi}$ of complex sinh-Gordon model coupled with $BC_n$ affine Toda theory. Perturbative calculations, analysis of the factorized scattering theory and the Bethe ansatz technique are applied to show that under duality transformation, which relates weak and strong coupling regimes of the theory the fermions $\psi,\psi^{\dagger}$ transform to bosons and $\chi,\bar{\chi}$ and vive versa. The scattering amplitudes of neutral particles in this theory coincide exactly with S-matrix of particles in pure $BC_n$   Toda theory, i.e. the contribution of charged bosons and fermions to these amplitudes exactly cancel each other. We describe and discuss the symmetry responsible for this compensation property. '
9905222;'N=2 Supersymmetric Model with Dirac-Kahler Fermions from Generalized';'Noboru Kawamoto and Takuya Tsukioka';'Mon, 31 May 1999 10:56:28 GMT   (16kb)';'   We investigate the generalized gauge theory which has been proposed previously and show that in two dimensions the instanton gauge fixing of the generalized topological Yang-Mills action leads to a twisted N=2 supersymmetric action. We have found that the R-symmetry of N=2 supersymmetry can be identified with the flavour symmetry of Dirac-Kahler fermion formulation. Thus the procedure of twist allows topological ghost fields to be interpreted as the Dirac-Kahler matter fermions. '
9905223;'Magnetic Monopoles Near the Black Hole Threshold';'Arthur Lue and Erick J. Weinberg (Columbia)';'Mon, 31 May 1999 00:43:43 GMT   (206kb)';'   We present new analytic and numerical results for self-gravitating SU(2)-Higgs magnetic monopoles approaching the black hole threshold. Our investigation extends to large Higgs self-coupling, lambda, a regime heretofore unexplored. When lambda is small, the critical solution where a horizon first appears is extremal Reissner-Nordstrom outside the horizon but has a nonsingular interior. When lambda is large, the critical solution is an extremal black hole with non-Abelian hair and a mass less than the extremal Reissner-Nordstrom value. The transition between these two regimes is reminiscent of a first-order phase transition. We analyze in detail the approach to these critical solutions as the Higgs expectation value is varied, and compare this analysis with the numerical results. '

The main topics are (i) an explicit construction of Whitham deformations of the Seiberg-Witten curves for classical gauge groups, (ii) its application to contact terms in the u-plane integral of topologically twisted theories, and (iii) a connection between the tau functions and the blowup formula in topologically twisted theories.

9905225;'Invariant Regularization of Supersymmetric Chiral Gauge Theory';'Hiroshi Suzuki (Ibaraki University)';'Mon, 31 May 1999 06:35:26 GMT   (16kb)';'   We present a regularization scheme which respects the supersymmetry and the maximal background gauge covariance in supersymmetric chiral gauge theories. When the anomaly cancellation condition is satisfied, the effective action in the superfield background field method automatically restores the gauge invariance without counterterms. The scheme also provides a background gauge covariant definition of composite operators that is especially useful in analyzing anomalies. We present several applications: The minimal consistent gauge anomaly; the super-chiral anomaly and the superconformal anomaly; as the corresponding anomalous commutators, the Konishi anomaly and an anomalous supersymmetric transformation law of the supercurrent (the ``central extension'' of N=1 supersymmetry algebra) and of the R-current.

9905226;'Spectrum of Type IIB Supergravity on AdS_5 x T^{11}: Predictions on N =';'Anna Ceresole, Gianguido Dall'Agata, Riccardo D'Auria and Sergio';'Mon, 31 May 1999 15:45:07 GMT   (30kb)';'   We derive the full Kaluza-Klein spectrum of type IIB supergravity compactified on AdS_5 x T^{11} with T^{11} = (SU(2) x SU(2))/U(1). From the knowledge of the spectrum and general multiplet shortening conditions, we make a refined test of the AdS/CFT correspondence, by comparison between various shortenings of SU(2,2|1) supermultiplets on AdS_5 and different families of boundary operators with protected dimensions. Additional towers of long multiplets with rational dimensions, that are not protected by supersymmetry, are also predicted from the supergravity analysis. '
9905227;'Spherically Collapsing Matter in AdS, Holography, and Shellons';'Ulf H. Danielsson, Esko Keski-Vakkuri, Martin Kruczenski';'Mon, 31 May 1999 15:23:10 GMT   (17kb)';'   We investigate the collapse of a spherical shell of matter in an anti-de Sitter space. We search for a holographic description of the collapsing shell in the boundary theory. It turns out that in the boundary theory it is possible to find information about the radial size of the shell. The shell deforms the background spacetime, and the deformed background metric enters into the action of a generic bulk field. As a consequence, the correlators of operators coupling to the bulk field are modified. By studying the analytic structure of the correlators, we find that in the boundary theory there are unstable excitations ("shellons") whose masses are multiples of a scale set by the radius of the shell. We also comment on the relation between black hole formation in the bulk and thermalization in the boundary. '
9905228;'Boundary Dynamics of Higher Dimensional AdS Spacetime';'J. Gegenberg (U. New Brunswick), G. Kunstatter (U. Winnipeg)';'Mon, 31 May 1999 18:04:23 GMT   (8kb)';'   We examine the dynamics induced on the four dimensional boundary of a five dimensional anti-deSitter spacetime by the five dimensional Chern-Simons theory with gauge group the direct product of SO(4,2) with U(1). We show that, given boundary conditions compatible with the geometry of 5d AdS spacetime in the asymptotic region, the induced surface theory is the $WZW_4$ model. '
9905229;'Fractons and Fractal Statistics';'Wellington da Cruz';'Mon, 31 May 1999 19:41:03 GMT   (20kb)';'   Fractons are anyons classified into equivalence classes and they obey a specific fractal statistics. The equivalence classes are labeled by a fractal parameter or Hausdorff dimension $h$. We consider this approach in the context of the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE) and the concept of duality between such classes, defined by $\tilde{h}=3-h$ shows us that the filling factors for which the FQHE were observed just appear into these classes. A connection between equivalence classes $h$ and the modular group for the quantum phase transitions of the FQHE is also obtained. A $\beta-$function is defined for a complex conductivity which embodies the classes $h$. The thermodynamics is also considered for a gas of fractons $(h,\nu)$ with a constant density of states and an exact equation of state is obtained at low-temperature and low-density limits. We also prove that the Farey sequences for rational numbers can be expressed in terms of the equivalence classes $h$. '
9905230;'Brane Configurations for Three-dimensional Nonabelian Orbifolds';'Tomomi Muto';'Mon, 31 May 1999 21:26:21 GMT   (25kb)';'   We study brane configurations corresponding to D-branes on complex three-dimensional orbifolds ${\bf C}^3/\Gamma$ with $\Gamma=\Delta(3n^2)$ and $\Delta(6n^2)$, nonabelian finite subgroups of SU(3). We first construct a brane configuration for ${\bf C}^3/{\bf Z}_n \times {\bf Z}_n$ by using D3-branes and a web of (p,q) 5-branes of type IIB string theory. Brane configurations for the nonabelian orbifolds are obtained by performing certain quotients on the configuration for ${\bf C}^3/{\bf Z}_n \times {\bf Z}_n$. Structure of the quiver diagrams of the groups $\Delta(3n^2)$ and $\Delta(6n^2)$ can be reproduced from the brane configurations. We point out that the brane configuration for ${\bf C}^3/\Gamma$ can be regarded as a physical realization of the quiver diagram of $\Gamma$. Based on this observation, we discuss that three-dimensional McKay correspondence may be interpreted as T-duality. '
9905231;'On the Geometric Properties of AdS Instantons';'Ali Kaya';'Mon, 31 May 1999 21:42:00 GMT   (16kb)';'   According to the positive energy conjecture of Horowitz and Myers, there is a specific supergravity solution, AdS soliton, which has minimum energy among all asymptotically locally AdS solutions with the same boundary conditions. Related to the issue of semiclassical stability of AdS soliton in the context of pure gravity with a negative cosmological constant, physical boundary conditions are determined for an instanton solution which would be responsible for vacuum decay by barrier penetration. Certain geometric properties of instantons are studied, using Hermitian differential operators. On a $d$-dimensional instanton, it is shown that there are $d-2$ harmonic functions. A class of instanton solutions, obeying more restrictive boundary conditions, is proved to have $d-1$ Killing vectors which also commute. All but one of the Killing vectors are duals of harmonic one-forms, which are gradients of harmonic functions, and do not have any fixed points. '
9906201;'Wilson loops from multicentre and rotating branes, mass gaps and phase';'A. Brandhuber and K. Sfetsos';'Fri, 25 Jun 1999 18:59:23 GMT   (38kb)';'   Within the AdS/CFT correspondence we use multicentre D3-brane metrics to investigate Wilson loops and compute the associated heavy quark-antiquark potentials for the strongly coupled SU(N) super-Yang-Mills gauge theory, when the gauge symmetry is broken by the expectation values of the scalar fields. For the case of a uniform distribution of D3-branes over a disc, we find that there exists a maximum separation beyond which there is no force between the quark and the antiquark, i.e. the screening is complete. We associate this phenomenon with the possible existence of a mass gap in the strongly coupled gauge theory. In the finite-temperature case, when the corresponding supergravity solution is a rotating D3-brane solution, there is a class of potentials interpolating between a Coulombic and a confining behaviour. However, above a certain critical value of the mass parameter, the potentials exhibit a behaviour characteristic of statistical systems undergoing phase transitions. The physical path preserves the concavity property of the potential and minimizes the energy. Using the same rotating-brane solutions, we also compute spatial Wilson loops, associated with the quark-antiquark potential in models of three-dimensional gauge theories at zero temperature, with similar results.

9906203;'Supergravity Solution for M5-brane Intersection';'Sergey A. Cherkis';'Fri, 25 Jun 1999 23:22:18 GMT   (9kb)';'   Supergravity solution describing two intersecting M5-branes is presented. The branes are fixed in the relative transverse directions and are delocalized along the overall transverse ones. The intersection can be smoothed, so that the M5-branes present one holomorphic cycle. We also obtain a solution corresponding to an M5-brane on a holomorphic cycle of multi-Taub-NUT space. All these solutions preserve 1/4 of supersymmetry. '
9906204;'Exponential and power-law hierarchies from supergravity';'A. Kehagias';'Fri, 25 Jun 1999 23:51:38 GMT   (14kb)';'   We examine how a d-dimensional mass hierarchy can be generated from a d+1-dimensional set up. We consider a d+1--dimensional scalar, the hierarchon, which has a potential as in gauged supergravities. We find that when it is in its minimum, there exist solutions of Horava-Witten topology R^d X S^1/Z^2 with domain walls at the fixed points and anti-de Sitter geometry in the bulk. We show that while standard Poincare supergravity leads to power-law hierarchies, (e.g. a power law dependence of masses on the compactification scale), gauged supergravity produce an exponential hierarchy as recently proposed by Randall and Sundrum.

9906205;'Bosonization at Finite Temperature and Anyon Condensation';'A. Liguori, M. Mintchev, L. Pilo';'Sat, 26 Jun 1999 09:11:32 GMT   (39kb)';'   An operator formalism for bosonization at finite temperature and density is developed. We treat the general case of anyon statistics. The exact $n$-point correlation functions, satisfying the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition, are explicitly constructed. The invariance under both vector and chiral transformations allows to introduce two chemical potentials. Investigating the exact momentum distribution, we discover anyon condensation in certain range of the statistical parameter. Another interesting feature is the occurrence of a non-vanishing persistent current. As an application of the general formalism, we solve the massless Thirring model at finite temperature, deriving the charge density and the persistent current. '
9906206;'Supergravity, D-brane Probes and thermal super Yang-Mills: a comparison';'E. Kiritsis (University of Crete)';'Sat, 26 Jun 1999 14:35:50 GMT   (232kb)';'   A D3-brane probe in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence at finite temperature is considered. The supergravity predictions for the physical effective couplings of the world-volume gauge theory of the probe brane are compared to those calculated in one-loop perturbation theory in the thermal gauge theory. It is argued that when the Higgs expectation value is much larger than the temperature, the supergravity result must agree with perturbative thermal Yang-Mills. This provides a perturbative test of the Maldacena conjecture. Predictions for the running electric and magnetic effective couplings, beyond perturbation theory are also obtained. Phenomenological applications for universe-branes are discussed. In particular mechanisms are suggested for reducing the induced cosmological constant and naturally obtaining a varying speed of light and a consequent inflation on the universe brane. '
9906207;'Picard-Fuchs Equations and Whitham Hierarchy in N=2 Supersymmetric';'Yuji Ohta (Res. Inst. Math. Sci., Kyoto Univ.)';'Sun, 27 Jun 1999 07:12:04 GMT   (9kb)';'   In general, Whitham dynamics involves infinitely many parameters called Whitham times, but in the context of N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory it can be regarded as a finite system by restricting the number of Whitham times appropriately. For example, in the case of SU(r+1) gauge theory without hypermultiplets, there are r Whitham times and they play an essential role in the theory. In this situation, the generating meromorphic 1-form of the Whitham hierarchy on Seiberg-Witten curve is represented by a finite linear combination of meromorphic 1-forms associated with these Whitham times, but it turns out that there are various differential relations among these differentials. Since these relations can be written only in terms of the Seiberg-Witten 1-form, their consistency conditions are found to give the Picard-Fuchs equations for the Seiberg-Witten periods. '
9906209;'Zero Locus Reduction of the BRST Differential';'M A Grigoriev (Lebedev Physics Institute)';'Mon, 28 Jun 1999 00:20:28 GMT   (12kb)';'   I point out an unexpected relation between the BV (Batalin-Vilkovisky) and the BFV (Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky) formulations of the same pure gauge (topological) theory. The nonminimal sector in the BV formulation of the topological theory allows one to construct the Poisson bracket and the BRST charge on some Lagrangian submanifold of the BV configuration space; this Lagrangian submanifold can be identified with the phase space of the BFV formulation of the same theory in the minimal sector of ghost variables. The BFV Poisson bracket is induced by a natural even Poisson bracket on the stationary surface of the master action, while the BRST charge originates from the BV gauge-fixed BRST transformation defined on a gauge-fixing surface. The inverse construction allows one to arrive at the BV formulation of the topological theory starting with the BFV formulation. This correspondence gives an intriguing geometrical interpretation of the nonminimal variables and clarifies the relation between the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian quantization of gauge theories.   This is an extended version of the talk given at the QFTHEP-99 workshop in Moscow, May 27 -June 2, 1999. '

A background geometry with N electric D3-branes is calculated in UV/IR regions. In this paper, we study a D5-brane around N D3-branes from the D5-brane world volume action as in the Type IIB case, and we obtain some baryon configurations at UV/IR regions. '
9906211;'Structure of the Electric Flux in N=4 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory';'J. Erickson, G.W. Semenoff and K. Zarembo';'Mon, 28 Jun 1999 10:38:19 GMT   (13kb)';'   Correlators of Wilson loop operators with O_4=Tr(F_{\mu\nu}^2+...) are computed in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory using the AdS/CFT correspondence. The results are compared with the leading order perturbative computations. As a consequence of conformal invariance, these correlators have identical forms in the weak and strong coupling limits for circular loops. They are essentially different for contours not protected by conformal symmetry. '

This is carried out using the original geometric loop construction of Manton. '

Liccardo';'Mon, 28 Jun 1999 12:03:51 GMT   (27kb)';'   We use the boundary state formalism to provide the full conformal description of (F,Dp) bound states. These are BPS configurations that arise from a superposition of a fundamental string and a Dp brane, and are charged under both the NS-NS antisymmetric tensor and the (p+1)-form R-R potential. We construct the boundary state for these bound states by switching on a constant electric field on the world-volume of a Dp brane and fix its value by imposing the Dirac quantization condition on the charges. Using the operator formalism we also derive the Dirac-Born-Infeld action and the classical supergravity solutions corresponding to these configurations. '
9906215;'Operator product expansion and factorization in the $H_3^+$-WZNW model';'J. Teschner';'Mon, 28 Jun 1999 14:28:34 GMT   (27kb)';'   Precise descriptions are given for the operator product expansion of generic primary fields as well as the factorization of four point functions as sum over intermediate states. The conjecture underlying the recent derivation of the space-time current algebra for string theory on $ADS_3$ by Kutasov and Seiberg is thereby verified. The roles of microscopic and macroscopic states are further clarified. The present work provides the conformal field theory prerequisites for a future study of factorization of amplitudes for string theory on $ADS_3$ as well as operator product expansion in the corresponding conformal field theory on the boundary.

9906216;'Running Gauge Coupling and Quark-Antiquark Potential in Non-SUSY Gauge';'Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov';'Mon, 28 Jun 1999 14:57:20 GMT   (15kb)';'   We discuss the non-constant dilaton deformed ${\rm AdS}_5\times{\rm S}_5$ solutions of IIB supergravity where AdS sector is described by black hole. The investigation of running gauge coupling (exponent of dilaton) of non-SUSY gauge theory at finite temperature is presented for different regimes (high or low T, large radius expansion). Running gauge coupling shows power-like behavior on temperature with stable fixed point. The quark-antiquark potential at finite T is found and possibility of confinement is established. It is shown that non-constant dilaton affects the potential, sometimes reversing its behavior  if we compare it with the constant dilaton case (${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory). Thermodynamics of obtained backgrounds is studied. In particular, next-to-leading term to free energy F is evaluated as $F=-{\tilde V_3 \over 4\pi^2}({N^2 (\pi T)^4 \over 2} + {5c^2 \over 768 g_{YM}^6 N{\alpha'}^6 (\pi T)^4})$. Here $\tilde V_3$ is the volume of the space part in the boundary of AdS, c is the parameter coming from the non-constant dilaton and N is the number of the coincident D3-branes. '
9906217;'Light-cone form of field dynamics in anti-de Sitter space-time and';'R.R.Metsaev, (Lebedev Physical Institute)';'Mon, 28 Jun 1999 17:20:01 GMT   (44kb)';'   Light-cone form of field dynamics in anti-de Sitter space-time is developed. Using field theoretic and group theoretic approaches the light-cone representation for generators of anti-de Sitter algebra acting as differential operators on bulk fields is found. We also present light-cone reformulation of the boundary conformal field theory representations. Making use of these explicit representations of AdS algebra as isometry algebra in the bulk and the algebra of conformal transformations at the boundary a precise correspondence between the bulk fields and the boundary operators is established.

9906218;'Non-Singular String-Cosmologies From Exact Conformal Field Theories';'H. J. de Vega, A. L. Larsen and N. Sanchez';'Mon, 28 Jun 1999 17:08:14 GMT   (29kb)';'   Non-singular two and three dimensional string cosmologies are constructed using the exact conformal field theories corresponding to SO(2,1)/SO(1,1) and SO(2,2)/SO(2,1). All semi-classical curvature singularities are canceled in the exact theories for both of these cosets, but some new quantum curvature singularities emerge. However, considering different patches of the global manifolds, allows the construction of non-singular spacetimes with cosmological interpretation. In both two and three dimensions, we construct non-singular oscillating cosmologies, non-singular expanding and inflationary cosmologies including a de Sitter (exponential) stage with positive scalar curvature as well as non-singular contracting and deflationary cosmologies. We analyse these cosmologies in detail with respect to the behaviour of the scale factors, the scalar curvature and the string-coupling. The sign of the scalar curvature is changed by the quantum corrections in oscillating cosmologies and evolves with time in the non-oscillating cases. Similarities between the two and three dimensional cases suggest a general picture for higher dimensional coset cosmologies: Anisotropy seems to be a generic unavoidable feature, cosmological singularities are generically avoided and it is possible to construct non-singular cosmologies where some spatial dimensions are experiencing inflation while the others experience deflation.

9906219;'On the relation between Stokes multipliers and the T-Q systems of';'Patrick Dorey and Roberto Tateo';'Mon, 28 Jun 1999 17:19:17 GMT   (50kb)';'   The vacuum expectation values of the so-called Q-operators of certain integrable quantum field theories have recently been identified with spectral determinants of particular Schrodinger operators. In this paper we extend the correspondence to the T-operators, finding that their vacuum expectation values also have an interpretation as spectral determinants. As byproducts we give a simple proof of an earlier conjecture of ours, proved by another route by Suzuki, and generalise a problem in PT symmetric quantum mechanics studied by Bender and Boettcher. We also stress that the mapping between Q-operators and Schrodinger equations means that certain problems in integrable quantum field theory are related to the study of Regge poles in non-relativistic potential scattering.

9906220;'Tachyon Stabilization in the AdS/CFT Correspondence';'Igor R. Klebanov';'Mon, 28 Jun 1999 19:57:11 GMT   (10kb)';'   We consider duality between type 0B string theory on $AdS_5\times S^5$ and the planar CFT on $N$ electric D3-branes coincident with $N$ magnetic D3-branes. It has been argued that this theory is stable up to a critical value of the `t Hooft coupling but is unstable beyond that point. We suggest that from the gauge theory point of view the development of instability is associated with singularity in the dimension of the operator corresponding to the tachyon field via the AdS/CFT map. Such singularities are common in large $N$ theories because summation over planar graphs typically has a finite radius of convergence. Hence we expect transitions between stability and instability for string theories in AdS backgrounds that are dual to certain large $N$ gauge theories: if there are tachyons for large AdS radius then they may be stabilized by reducing the radius below a critical value of order the string scale.

9906222;'A Remark on Brane Stabilization in Brane World';'Zurab Kakushadze';'Mon, 28 Jun 1999 21:55:49 GMT   (11kb)';'   In this note we discuss dynamical mechanisms for brane stabilization in the brane world context. In particular, we consider supersymmetry preserving brane stabilization, and also brane stabilization accompanied by supersymmetry breaking. These mechanisms are realized in some four dimensional N=1 supersymmetric orientifold models. For illustrative purposes we consider two explicit orientifold models previously constructed in hep-th/9806008. In both of these models branes are stabilized at a finite distance from the orientifold planes. In the first model brane stabilization occurs via supersymmetry preserving non-perturbative gauge dynamics. In the second model supersymmetry is dynamically broken, and brane stabilization is due to an interplay between non-perturbatively generated superpotential and tree-level Kahler potential. '

The two-time string or p-brane action can be gauge fixed to produce various one-time string or p-brane actions that are dual to each other under gauge transformations. We discuss the particular gauges that correspond to tensionless strings and p-branes in flat (d-1)+1 spacetime, rigid strings and p-branes in flat (d-1)+1 spacetime, and tensionless strings and p-branes propagating in the AdS_{d-n} x S^n backgrounds.

We use the path integral approach to obtain expressions for $n$-point functions. Perturbation theory leads us to generalised Feynman diagrams which are braided, i.e., they have non-trivial over- and under-crossings. We demonstrate the power of our approach by applying it to $\phi^4$-theory on the quantum 2-sphere. We find that the basic divergent diagram of the theory is regularised. '

These 1-point functions are directly related to the asymptotic behaviour of bulk fields. In some cases, distinct supergravity solutions have identical asymptotic behaviour; so dual expectation values are insufficient to distinguish them. We argue that non-local objects in the gauge theory can resolve the ambiguity, and explicitly show that collections of point particles in AdS_3 can be detected by studying kinks in dual CFT Green functions. Three dimensional black holes can be formed by collision of such particles. We show how black hole formation can be detected in the holographic dual, and calculate CFT quantities that are sensitive to the distribution of matter inside the event horizon. '
9906227;'SO(2) symmetry of a Maxwell p-form theory';'D. Chruscinski';'Tue, 29 Jun 1999 08:43:14 GMT   (5kb)';'   We find a universal SO(2) symmetry of a p-form Maxwell theory for both odd and even p. For odd p it corresponds to the duality rotations but for even p it defines a new set of transformations which is not related to duality rotations. In both cases a symmetry group defines a subgroup of the O(2,1) group of R-linear canonical transformations which has also a natural representation on the level of quantization condition for p-brane dyons.

9906228;'Casimir Energies for Spherically Symmetric Cavities';'Guido Cognola, Emilio Elizalde and Klaus Kirsten';'Tue, 29 Jun 1999 12:04:35 GMT   (19kb)';'   A general calculation of Casimir energies --in an arbitrary number of dimensions-- for massless quantized fields in spherically symmetric cavities is carried out. All the most common situations, including scalar and spinor fields, the electromagnetic field, and various boundary conditions are treated with care. The final results are given as analytical (closed) expressions in terms of Barnes zeta functions. A direct, straightforward numerical evaluation of the formulas is then performed, which yields highly accurate numbers of, in principle, arbitrarily good precision. '
9906229;'On the concept of determinant for the differential operators of Quantum';'E. Elizalde';'Tue, 29 Jun 1999 12:23:13 GMT   (11kb)';'   The concept of determinant for a linear operator in an infinite-dimensional space is addressed, by using the derivative of the operator's zeta-function (following Ray and Singer) and, eventually, through its zeta-function trace. A little play with operators as simple as $\pm I$ ($I$ being the identity operator) and variations thereof, shows that the presence of a non-commutative anomaly (i.e., the fact that det $(AB) \neq$ det $A$ det $B$), is unavoidable, even for commuting and, remarkably, also for almost constant operators. In the case of Dirac-type operators, similarly basic arguments lead to the conclusion ---contradicting common lore--- that in spite of being $\det (\slash D +im) = \det (\slash D -im)$ (as follows from the symmetry condition of the $\slash D$-spectrum), it turns out that these determinants may {\it not} be equal to $\sqrt{\det (\slash D^2 +m^2)}$, simply because $\det [(\slash D +im) (\slash D -im)] \neq \det (\slash D +im) \det (\slash D -im)$. A proof of this fact is given, by way of a very simple example, using operators with an harmonic-oscillator spectrum and fulfilling the symmetry condition. This anomaly can be physically relevant if, in addition to a mass term (or instead of it), a chemical potential contribution is added to the Dirac operator. '
9906230;'Target-Superspace in 2d Dilatonic Supergravity';'Thomas Strobl';'Tue, 29 Jun 1999 13:26:04 GMT   (13kb)';'   The N=1 supersymmetric version of generalized 2d dilaton gravity can be cast into the form of a Poisson Sigma Model, where the target space and its Poisson bracket are graded. The target space consists of a 1+1 superspace and the dilaton, which is the generator of Lorentz boosts therein. The Poisson bracket on the target space induces the invariance of the worldsheet theory against both diffeomorphisms and local supersymmetry transformations (superdiffeomorphisms). The machinery of Poisson Sigma Models is then used to find the general local solution to the field equations. As a byproduct, classical equivalence between the bosonic theory and its supersymmetric extension is found. '
9906231;'Two Loop Locally Anisotropic Corrections for Nonlinear Sigma Model';'Sergiu Ostaf';'Tue, 29 Jun 1999 13:35:45 GMT   (25kb)';'   The article gives explicit calculation and interpretation of the additional locally anisotropic effects. Double role of the resulted gauge like fields discussed. '
9906232;'Probing partially localized supergravity background of fundamental';'Donam Youm';'Tue, 29 Jun 1999 15:26:48 GMT   (14kb)';'   We study the dynamics of the probe fundamental string in the field background of the partially localized supergravity solution for the fundamental string ending on Dp-brane. We separately analyze the probe dynamics for its motion along the worldvolume direction and the transverse direction of the source Dp-brane. We compare the dynamics of the probe along the Dp-brane worldvolume direction to the BIon dynamics. '

Zheltukhin';'Tue, 29 Jun 1999 15:44:15 GMT   (10kb)';'   We give the Lax representations for for the elliptic, hyperbolic and homogeneous second order Monge-Ampere equations. The connection between these equations and the equations of hydrodynamical type give us a scalar dispersionless Lax representation. A matrix dispersive Lax representation follows from the correspondence between sigma models, a two parameter equation for minimal surfaces and Monge-Ampere equations. Local as well nonlocal conserved densities are obtained. '
9906234;'A Note on Orientifolds and Dualities of Type 0B String Theory';'Ralph Blumenhagen and Alok Kumar';'Tue, 29 Jun 1999 16:01:24 GMT   (12kb)';'   We generalize the construction of four dimensional non-tachyonic orientifolds of type 0B string theory to non-supersymmetric backgrounds. We construct a four dimensional model containing self-dual D3 and D9-branes and leading to a chiral anomaly-free massless spectrum. Moreover, we discuss a further tachyon-free six dimensional model with only D5 branes. Eventually, we speculate about strong coupling dual models of the ten-dimensional orientifolds of type 0B. '

Rubtsov';'Tue, 29 Jun 1999 16:06:09 GMT   (40kb)';'   We discuss various dualities, relating integrable systems and show that these dualities are explained in the framework of Hamiltonian and Poisson reductions. The dualities we study shed some light on the known integrable systems as well as allow to construct new ones, double elliptic among them. We also discuss applications to the (supersymmetric) gauge theories in various dimensions. '
9906236;'Chiral Symmetry restoration in the massive Thirring model at finite T';'A.Gomez Nicola (UCM, Madrid), R.J.Rivers (Imperial College, London),';'Tue, 29 Jun 1999 16:42:51 GMT   (50kb)';'   We show that in certain limits the (1+1)-dimensional massive Thirring model at finite temperature $T$ is equivalent to a one-dimensional Coulomb gas of charged particles at the same $T$. This equivalence is then used to explore the phase structure of the massive Thirring model. For strong coupling and $T>>m$ (the fermion mass) the system is shown to behave as a free gas of "molecules" (charge pairs in the Coulomb gas terminology) made of pairs of chiral condensates. This binding of chiral condensates is responsible for the restoration of chiral symmetry as $T\to\infty$. In addition, when a fermion chemical potential $\mu\neq 0$ is included, the analogy with a Coulomb gas still holds with $\mu$ playing the role of a purely imaginary external electric field. For small $T$ and $\mu$ we find a typical massive Fermi gas behaviour for the fermion density, whereas for large $\mu$ it shows chiral restoration by means of a vanishing effective fermion mass. Some similarities with the chiral properties of low-energy QCD at finite $T$ and baryon chemical potential are discussed. '
9906237;'Dynamics of the DBI Spike Soliton';'David Kastor and Jennie Traschen';'Tue, 29 Jun 1999 16:54:22 GMT   (16kb)';'   We compare oscillations of a fundamental string ending on a D3-brane in two different settings: (1) a test-string radially threading the horizon of an extremal black D3-brane and (2) the spike soliton of the DBI effective action for a D3-brane. Previous work has shown that overall transverse modes of the test-string appear as l=0 modes of the transverse scalar fields of the DBI system. We identify DBI world-volume degrees of freedom that have dynamics matching those of the test-string relative transverse modes. We show that there is a map, resembling T-duality, between relative and overall transverse modes for the test-string that interchanges Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions and implies equality of the absorption coefficients for both modes. We give general solutions to the overall and relative transverse parts of the DBI coupled gauge and scalar system and calculate absorption coefficients for the higher angular momentum modes in the low frequency limit. We find that there is a nonzero amplitude for l>0 modes to travel out to infinity along the spike, demonstrating that the spike remains effectively 3+1-dimensional. '
9906238;'Ultraviolet Limit of Open String Theory';'Shyamoli Chaudhuri';'Tue, 29 Jun 1999 21:26:05 GMT   (18kb)';'   We confirm the intuition that a string theory which is perturbatively infrared finite is automatically perturbatively ultraviolet finite. Our derivation based on the asymptotics of the Selberg trace formula for the Greens function on a Riemann surface holds for both open and closed string amplitudes and is independent of modular invariance and supersymmetry. The masses of the open strings stretched between Dbranes give a natural world-sheet ultraviolet regulator for the string path integral preserving both T-duality and open-closed string world-sheet duality. '
9906239;'One-loop corrections to the D3 brane action';'Marina Shmakova';'Tue, 29 Jun 1999 22:18:54 GMT   (16kb)';'   We calculate one-loop corrections to the effective Lagrangian for the D3 brane. We perform the gauge-fixing of the kappa-symmetric Born-Infeld D3 brane action in the flat background using Killing gauge. The linearized supersymmetry of the gauge-fixed action coincides with that of the N=4 Yang-Mills theory. We use the helicity amplitude and unitarity technique to calculate the one-loop amplitudes at order alpha^4. The counterterms and the finite 1-loop corrections are of the form (dF)^4 and their supersymmetric generalization. This is to be contrasted with the Born-Infeld action which contains (F)^4 and other terms which do not depend on derivatives of the vector field strength. '
9906240;'On Double-Elliptic Integrable Systems. 1. A Duality Argument for the';'H.W.Braden, A.Marshakov, A.Mironov and A.Morozov';'Tue, 29 Jun 1999 22:23:02 GMT   (19kb)';'   We construct a two parameter family of 2-particle Hamiltonians closed under the duality operation of interchanging the (relative) momentum and coordinate. Both coordinate and momentum dependence are elliptic, and the modulus of the momentum torus is a non-trivial function of the coordinate. This model contains as limiting cases the standard Ruijsenaars-Calogero and Toda family of Hamiltonians, which are at most elliptic in the coordinates, but not in the momenta. '
9906241;'The vacuum backreaction on a pair creating source';'G. A. Vilkovisky (Lebedev Institute)';'Wed, 30 Jun 1999 00:35:28 GMT   (11kb)';'   Solution is presented to the simplest problem about the vacuum backreaction on a pair creating source. The backreaction effect is nonanalytic in the coupling constant and restores completely the energy conservation law. The vacuum changes the kinematics of motion like relativity theory does and imposes a new upper bound on the velocity of the source. '
9906242;'Fractional Branes and Boundary States in Orbifold Theories';'Duiliu-Emanuel Diaconescu, Jaume Gomis';'Wed, 30 Jun 1999 22:02:32 GMT   (38kb)';'   We study the D-brane spectrum of N=2 string orbifold theories using the boundary state formalism. The construction is carried out for orbifolds with isolated singularities, non-isolated singularities and orbifolds with discrete torsion. Our results agree with the corresponding K-theoretic predictions when they are available and generalize them when they are not. This suggests that the classification of boundary states provides a sort of "quantum K-theory" just as chiral rings in CFT provide "quantum" generalizations of cohomology. We discuss the identification of these states with D-branes wrapping holomorphic cycles in the large radius limit of the CFT moduli space. The example C^3/Z_3 is worked out in full detail using local mirror symmetry techniques. We find a precise correspondence between fractional branes at the orbifold point and configurations of D-branes described by vector bundles on the exceptional P^2 cycle. '
9906243;'Vortices on the Higgs Branch of the Seiberg-Witten Theory';'Alexei Yung (Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute)';'Wed, 30 Jun 1999 13:39:03 GMT   (18kb)';'   We study the mechanism of confinement via formation of Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen vortices on the Higgs branch of N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) gauge theory with massive fundamental matter. Higgs branch represents a limiting case of superconductor of type I with vanishing Higgs mass. We show that in this limit vortices still exist although they become logarithmically "thick". Because of this the confining potential is not linear any longer. It behaves as $L/\log L$ with a distance $L$ between confining heavy charges (monopoles). This new confining regime can occur only in supersymmetric theories. We also address the problem of quantum stability of vortices. To this end we develop string representation for a vortex and use it to argue that vortices remain stable. '
9906244;'Monopoles, Dyons and Theta Term in Dirac-Born-Infeld Theory';'N. Grandi, R.L. Pakman, F.A.Schaposnik and G. Silva';'Wed, 30 Jun 1999 14:57:54 GMT   (21kb)';'   We present dyon solutions to an SU(2) Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) gauge theory coupled to a Higgs triplet. We consider different non-Abelian extensions of the DBI action and study the resulting solutions numerically, comparing them with the standard Julia-Zee dyons. We discuss the existence of a critical value of $\beta$, the Born-Infeld absolute field parameter, below which the solution ceases to exist. We also analyse the effect of modifying the DBI action so as to include the analogous of the $\theta$ term, showing that Witten formula for the dyon charge also holds in DBI theories. '
9906245;'Some Generalized BRS Transformations.I The Pure Yang-Mills Case';'Paul Federbush (Univ. of Michigan)';'Wed, 30 Jun 1999 17:02:43 GMT   (4kb)';'   Some generalized BRS transformations are developed for the pure Yang-Mills theory, and a form of quantum gravity. Unlike the usual BRS transformations: these are nonlocal; may be infinite formal power series in the gauge fields; and do not leave the action invariant, but only the product exp(-S) with the Jacobian. Similar constructions should exist for many other field theory situations. '
9906246;'Remarks on the Racetrack Scheme';'Michael Dine and Yuri Shirman';'Wed, 30 Jun 1999 18:57:12 GMT   (17kb)';'   There are only a small number of ideas for stabilizing the moduli of string theory. One of the most appealing of these is the racetrack mechanism, in which a delicate interplay between two strongly interacting gauge groups fixes the value of the coupling constant. In this note, we explore this scenario. We find that quite generally, some number of discrete tunings are required in order that the mechanism yield a small gauge coupling. Even then, there is no sense in which a weak coupling approximation is valid. On the other hand, certain holomorphic quantities can be computed, so such a scheme is in principle predictive. Searching for models which realize this mechanism is thus of great interest. We also remark on cosmology in these schemes. '
9906247;'Supergravity Solution for Three-String Junction in M-Theory';'P. Ramadevi';'Wed, 30 Jun 1999 17:58:25 GMT   (7kb)';'   Three-String junctions are allowed configurations in II B string theory which preserve one-fourth supersymmetry. We obtain the 11-dimensional supergravity solution for curved membranes corresponding to these three-string junctions. '
9906248;'On the Quantization of Nambu Brackets';'Hidetoshi Awata, Miao Li, Djordje Minic and Tamiaki Yoneya';'Wed, 30 Jun 1999 18:31:37 GMT   (13kb)';'   We present several non-trivial examples of the three-dimensional quantum Nambu bracket which involve square matrices or three-index objects. Our examples satisfy two fundamental properties of the classical Nambu bracket: they are skew-symmetric and they obey the Fundamental Identity. We contrast our approach to the existing literature on the quantum deformations of Nambu mechanics. We also discuss possible applications of our results in M-theory. '
9907201;'Electric Black Holes in Type 0 String Theory';'Ivo Sachs';'Tue, 27 Jul 1999 18:41:05 GMT   (10kb)';'   We discuss AdS_{2+1} (BTZ) black holes arising in type 0 string theory corresponding to D1-D5 and F1-NS5 bound states. In particular we describe a new family of non-dilatonic solutions with only Dp_{+}, that is ``electric'' branes. These solutions are distinguished by the absence of fermions in the world volume theory which is an interacting CFT. They can not be obtained as a projection of a type II BPS-configuration. As for previous type 0 backgrounds linear stability is guaranteed only if the curvature is of the order of the string scale where alpha' corrections cannot be excluded. Some problems concerning the counting of states are discussed. '
9907202;'T-Duality in the Green-Schwarz Formalism, and the Massless/Massive IIA';'M. Cvetic, H. Lu, C.N. Pope and K.S. Stelle';'Tue, 27 Jul 1999 22:09:51 GMT   (29kb)';'   We derive a component-field expansion of the Green-Schwarz action for the type IIA string, in an arbitrary background of massless NS-NS and R-R bosonic fields, up to quadratic order in the fermionic coordinates \theta. Using this action, we extend the usual derivation of Buscher T-duality rules to include not only NS-NS, but also R-R fields. Our implementation of the T-duality transformation rules makes use of adapted background-field parametrizations, which provide a more geometrically natural and elegant description for the duality maps than the ones previously presented. These T-duality rules allow us to derive the Green-Schwarz action for the type IIB string in an arbitrary background of massless NS-NS and R-R bosonic fields, up to O(\theta^2). Implemention of another T-duality transformation on this type IIB action then allows us also to derive the Green-Schwarz action for the massive IIA string. By further considering T-duality transformations for backgrounds with the two U(1) isometries of a 2-torus, we give a string-theoretic derivation of the direct T-duality relation between the massless and massive type IIA strings. In addition, we give an explicit construction of the D=8 SL(3,R)xSL(2,R) invariant supergravity with two mass parameters that form a doublet under the SL(2,R) factor. '
9907203;'Anomaly Cancelations in Orientifolds with Quantized B Flux';'Alex Buchel, Gary Shiu and S.-H. Henry Tye';'Tue, 27 Jul 1999 22:01:18 GMT   (35kb)';'   We consider anomaly cancelations in Type IIB orientifolds on T^4/Z_N with quantized NS-NS sector background B-flux. For a rank b B-flux on T^4 (b is always even) and when N is even, the cancelation requires a 2^{b/2} multiplicity of states in the 59-open string sector. We identify the twisted sector R-R scalars and tensor multiplets which are involved in the Green-Schwarz mechanism. We give more details of the construction of these models and argue that consistency with the 2^{b/2} multiplicity of 59-sector states requires a modification of the relation between the open string 1-loop channel modulus and the closed string tree channel modulus in the 59-cylinder amplitudes. '
9907204;'D3-brane shells to black branes on the Coulomb branch';'S. B. Giddings and S. F. Ross';'Tue, 27 Jul 1999 21:41:24 GMT   (16kb)';'   We use the AdS/CFT duality to study the special point on the Coulomb branch of ${\cal N}=4$ SU(N) gauge theory which corresponds to a spherically symmetric shell of D3-branes. This point is of interest both because the spacetime region inside the shell is flat, and because this configuration gives a very simple example of the transition between D-branes in the perturbative string regime and the non-perturbative regime of black holes. We discuss how this geometry is described in the dual gauge theory, through its effect on the two-point functions and Wilson loops. In the calculation of the two-point function, we stress the importance of absorption by the branes. '
9907205;'Ultraviolet and Infrared freedom from string amplitudes';'Enrique Alvarez and Cesar Gomez';'Wed, 28 Jul 1999 10:34:11 GMT   (26kb)';'   The infinite tension limit of string amplitudes is examined with some care, identifying the part responsible of diamagnetic behaviour as well as a peculiar paramagnetic {\em tachyon magnifying} responsible of asymptotic freedom. The way string theory represents abelian gauge theories is connected with the non-planar reggeon/pomeron amplitude and a nontrivial beta function is found in the low energy limit of a single D-brane.

These theories have (tensionless) BPS string solitons. We use a dual supergravity formulation to deduce some of their properties via the AdS/CFT correspondence. '

Actually, we consider the tracker potential type $V = V_0/{\phi}^{\alpha}$ and show that duality is only established if $\alpha = - 2$. '
9907208;'Derivative Expansion and Soliton Masses';'Gerald V. Dunne';'Wed, 28 Jul 1999 20:55:16 GMT   (39kb)';'   We present a simple algorithm to implement the generalized derivative expansion introduced previously by L-H. Chan, and apply it to the calculation of the one-loop mass correction to the classical soliton mass in the 1+1 dimensional Jacobi model. We then show how this derivative expansion approach implies that the total (bosonic plus fermionic) mass correction in an N=1 supersymmetric soliton model is determined solely by the asymptotic values (and derivatives) of the fermionic background potential. For a static soliton the total mass correction is $-m/(2\pi)$, in agreement with recent analyses using phase-shift methods. '
9907209;'Infinitely Large New Dimensions';'Nima Arkani-Hamed, Savas Dimopoulos, Gia Dvali and Nemanja Kaloper';'Thu, 29 Jul 1999 22:48:13 GMT   (8kb)';'   We construct intersecting brane configurations in Anti-de-Sitter space localizing gravity to the intersection region, with any number $n$ of extra dimensions. This allows us to construct two kinds of theories with infinitely large new dimensions, TeV scale quantum gravity and sub-millimeter deviations from Newton's Law. The effective 4D Planck scale $M_{Pl}$ is determined in terms of the fundamental Planck scale $M_*$ and the $AdS$ radius of curvature $L$ via the familiar relation $M_{Pl}^2 \sim M_{*}^{2+n} L^n$; $L$ acts as an effective radius of compactification for gravity on the intersection. Taking $M_* \sim $ TeV and $L \sim $ sub-mm reproduces the phenomenology of theories with large extra dimensions. Alternately, taking $M_* \sim L^{-1} \sim M_{Pl}$, and placing our 3-brane a distance $\sim 100 M_{Pl}^{-1}$ away from the intersection gives us a theory with an exponential determination of the Weak/Planck hierarchy. '
9907210;'Heterotic Little String Theories and Holography';'Martin Gremm, Anton Kapustin';'Wed, 28 Jul 1999 23:55:14 GMT   (19kb)';'   It has been conjectured that Little String Theories in six dimensions are holographic to critical string theory in a linear dilaton background. We test this conjecture for theories arising on the worldvolume of heterotic fivebranes. We compute the spectrum of chiral primaries in these theories and compare with results following from Type I-heterotic duality and the AdS/CFT correspondence. We also construct holographic duals for heterotic fivebranes near orbifold singularities. Finally we find several new Little String Theories which have Spin(32)/Z_2 or E_8 \times E_8 global symmetry but do not have a simple interpretation either in heterotic or M-theory. '
9907211;'Matrix Theory Star Products from the Born-Infeld Action';'Lorenzo Cornalba and Ricardo Schiappa';'Thu, 29 Jul 1999 00:34:56 GMT   (15kb)';'   We conjecture that the Sen-Seiberg limit of the Type IIA D2-brane action in a flat spacetime background can be resummed, at all orders in \alpha', to define an associative star product on the membrane. This star product can be independently constrained from the equivalent Matrix theory description of the corresponding M2-brane, by carefully analyzing the known BPS conditions. Higher derivative corrections to the Born-Infeld action on the IIA side are reinterpreted, after the Sen-Seiberg limit, as higher derivative corrections to a field theory on the membrane, which itself can be resummed to yield the known Matrix theory quantum mechanics action. Conversely, given the star product on the membrane as a formal power series in \alpha', one can constrain the higher derivative corrections to the Born-Infeld action, in the Sen-Seiberg limit. This claim is explicitly verified to first order. Finally, we also comment on the possible application of this method to the derivation of the Matrix theory action for membranes in a curved background. '
9907212;'Non-Locality and Ellipticity in a Gauge-Invariant Quantization';'Giampiero Esposito and Cosimo Stornaiolo';'Thu, 29 Jul 1999 07:17:51 GMT   (11kb)';'   The quantum theory of a free particle in two dimensions with non-local boundary conditions on a circle is known to lead to surface and bulk states. Such a scheme is here generalized to the quantized Maxwell field, subject to mixed boundary conditions. If the Robin sector is modified by the addition of a pseudo-differential boundary operator, gauge-invariant boundary conditions are obtained at the price of dealing with gauge-field and ghost operators which become pseudo-differential. A good elliptic theory is then obtained if the kernel occurring in the boundary operator obeys certain summability conditions, and it leads to a peculiar form of the asymptotic expansion of the symbol. The cases of ghost operator of negative and positive order are studied within this framework. '
9907214;'$(\alpha')^4$ corrections to the N=2 supersymmetric Born-Infeld action';'A. De Giovanni, A. Santambrogio and D. Zanon';'Thu, 29 Jul 1999 10:21:37 GMT   (13kb)';'   We consider the N=2 supersymmetric Born-Infeld action and compute one-loop divergences quantizing the theory in N=1 superspace. We find that in the presence of non constant curvature the theory is not renormalizable. The structure of the $(\alpha')^4$ counterterm, proportional to derivatives of the curvature, is consistent with effective action calculations from superstring theory. '
9907215;'Gravitational Couplings, Orientifolds and M-Planes';'Sunil Mukhi and Nemani V. Suryanarayana';'Thu, 29 Jul 1999 11:42:42 GMT   (13kb)';'   We examine string-theory orientifold planes of various types including the Sp and SO-odd planes, and deduce the gravitational Chern-Simons couplings on their world-volumes. Consistency checks are carried out in different spacetime dimensions using various dualities, including those relating string theory with F-theory and M-theory. It is shown that when an orientifold 3-plane crosses a 5-brane, the jump in the charge is accompanied by a corresponding change in the gravitational couplings. '
9907216;'KK Spectroscopy of Type IIB Supergravity on AdS_5 x T^{11}';'Anna Ceresole, Gianguido Dall'Agata and Riccardo D'Auria';'Thu, 29 Jul 1999 13:04:38 GMT   (35kb)';'   We give full details for the computation of the Kaluza--Klein mass spectrum of Type IIB Supergravity on AdS_5 x T^{11}, with T^{11}=SU(2)xSU(2)/U(1), that has recently lead to both stringent tests and interesting predictions on the AdS_5/CFT_4 correspondence for N=1 SCFT's (hep-th/9905226). We exhaustively explain how KK states arrange into SU(2,2|1) supermultiplets, and stress some relevant features of the T^{11} manifold, such as the presence of topological modes in the spectrum originating from the existence of non-trivial 3-cycles. The corresponding Betti vector multiplet is responsible for the extra baryonic symmetry in the boundary CFT. More generally, we use the simple T^{11} coset as a laboratory to revive the technique and show the power of KK harmonic expansion, in view of the present attempts to probe along the same lines also M-theory compactifications and the AdS_4/CFT_3 map.

The restrictions on the gauge parameters found by earlier approaches are easily reproduced from this equation. We also discuss the connection with the purely Lagrangian approach. The general considerations are applied to the Yang-Mills theory. '

9907219;'3D superconformal theories from Sasakian seven-manifolds: new nontrivial';'Davide Fabbri, Pietro Fre', Leonardo Gualtieri, Cesare Reina,';'Thu, 29 Jul 1999 15:23:56 GMT   (76kb)';'   In this paper we discuss candidate superconformal N=2 gauge theories that realize the AdS/CFT correspondence with M--theory compactified on the homogeneous Sasakian 7-manifolds M^7 that were classified long ago. In particular we focus on the two cases M^7=Q^{1,1,1} and M^7=M^{1,1,1}, for the latter the Kaluza Klein spectrum being completely known. We show how the toric description of M^7 suggests the gauge group and the supersingleton fields. The conformal dimensions of the latter can be independently calculated by comparison with the mass of baryonic operators that correspond to 5-branes wrapped on supersymmetric 5-cycles and are charged with respect to the Betti multiplets. The entire Kaluza Klein spectrum of short multiplets agrees with these dimensions. Furthermore, the metric cone over the Sasakian manifold is a conifold algebraically embedded in some C^p. The ring of chiral primary fields is defined as the coordinate ring of C^p modded by the ideal generated by the embedding equations; this ideal has a nice characterization by means of representation theory. The entire Kaluza Klein spectrum is explained in terms of these vanishing relations. We give the superfield interpretation of all short multiplets and we point out the existence of many long multiplets with rational protected dimensions, whose presence and pattern seem to be universal in all compactifications.

Depending on the choice of the boundary condition at the location of the vortex, either chiral symmetry or parity is broken; the formation of the appropriate vacuum condensates is comprehensively studied. In addition, we find that current, energy and other quantum numbers are induced in the vacuum. '
9907224;'N=4 Supersymmetric Multidimensional Quantum Mechanics, Partial SUSY';'E. E. Donets, A. Pashnev, J. Juan Rosales and M. M. Tsulaia';'Fri, 30 Jul 1999 14:28:38 GMT   (16kb)';'   The multidimensional N=4 supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY QM) is constructed using the superfield approach. As a result, the component form of the classical and quantum Lagrangian and Hamiltonian is obtained. In the considered SUSY QM both classical and quantum N=4 algebras include central charges, and this opens various possibilities for partial supersymmetry breaking. It is shown that quantum mechanical models with one quarter, one half and three quarters of unbroken(broken) supersymmetries can exist in the framework of the multidimensional N=4 SUSY QM, while the one-dimensional N=4 SUSY QM, constructed earlier, admits only one half or total supersymmetry breakdown. We illustrate the constructed general formalism, as well as all possible cases of the partial SUSY breaking taking as an example a direct multidimensional generalization of the one-dimensional N=4 superconformal quantum mechanical model. Some open questions and possible applications of the constructed multidimensional N=4 SUSY QM to the known exactly integrable systems and problems of quantum cosmology are briefly discussed. '
9907225;'Dynamical Supersymmetry Breaking';'Yael Shadmi and Yuri Shirman';'Fri, 30 Jul 1999 17:20:29 GMT   (71kb)';'   Supersymmetry is one of the most plausible and theoretically motivated frameworks for extending the Standard Model. However, any supersymmetry in Nature must be a broken symmetry. Dynamical supersymmetry breaking (DSB) is an attractive idea for incorporating supersymmetry into a successful description of Nature. The study of DSB has recently enjoyed dramatic progress, fueled by advances in our understanding of the dynamics of supersymmetric field theories. These advances have allowed for direct analysis of DSB in strongly coupled theories, and for the discovery of new DSB theories, some of which contradict early criteria for DSB. We review these criteria, emphasizing recently discovered exceptions. We also describe, through many examples, various techniques for directly establishing DSB by studying the infrared theory, including both older techniques in regions of weak coupling, and new techniques in regions of strong coupling. Finally, we present a list of representative DSB models, their main properties, and the relations between them. '
9908201;'Instantons, finite N=2 Sp(N) theories and the AdS/CFT correspondence';'Timothy J. Hollowood';'Mon, 30 Aug 1999 21:03:52 GMT   (16kb)';'   We examine ADHM multi-instantons in the conformal N=2 supersymmetric Sp(N) gauge theory with one anti-symmetric tensor and four fundamental hypermultiplets. We argue that the ADHM construction and measure can also be deduced from purely field theoretic considerations and also from the dynamics of D-instantons in the presence of D3-branes, D7-branes and an orientifold O7-plane. The measure then admits a large-N saddle-point approximation where the D3-branes disappear but the background is changed to AdS_5 x S^5/Z_2, as expected on the basis of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The large-N measure displays the fractionation of D-instantons at the singularity S^3 in S^5/Z_2 and is described for instanton number k by a certain O(k) matrix model. '
9908202;'Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics from Light Cone Quantization';'S. Hellerman and J. Polchinski';'Mon, 30 Aug 1999 18:53:45 GMT   (12kb)';'   We study the supersymmetric quantum mechanical systems that arise from discrete light cone quantization of theories with minimal supersymmetry in various dimensions. These systems, which have previously arisen in the study of black hole moduli spaces, are distinguished by having fewer fermionic fields than the familiar K\"ahler and hyper-K\"ahler models. '
9908203;'A toy model of Polyakov duality';'Vipul Periwal';'Mon, 30 Aug 1999 19:47:54 GMT   (8kb)';'   Polyakov has conjectured that Yang-Mills theory should be equivalent to a noncritical string theory. I pointed out, based on the work of Marchesini, Ishibashi, Kawai and collaborators, and Jevicki and Rodrigues, that the loop operator of the Yang-Mills theory is the temporal gauge string field theory Hamiltonian of a noncritical string theory. In the present note I explicitly show how this works for the one--plaquette model, providing a consistent direct string interpretation of the unitary matrix model for the first time. '
9908204;'The Freckled Instantons';'A.Losev, N.Nekrasov and S.Shatashvili';'Mon, 30 Aug 1999 20:57:49 GMT   (49kb)';'   We study instanton-corrected renormalization group flow in the two dimensional sigma models and four dimensional gauge theory. In two dimensions we do that by replacing the non-linear supersymmetric ${\IC\IP}^{N-1}$ model by the gauged linear sigma model which is in the same universality class. We compare the moduli spaces of the instantons in the non-linear model and that of BPS field configurations in the linear model. We reduce the problem of matching of the parameters of the two systems to the intersection theory on the compact moduli space of the latter model. Both cases (2d and 4d) are unified by the notion of the {\it freckled instantons}. We also put an end to the discussion of the nature of the superpotentials $W \sim {\s} {\rm log} {\s}$ in 2d and 4d and discover the surprising disconnectnessness of the effective target space. '
9908205;'10 = 6 + 4';'Frank Tony Smith';'Tue, 31 Aug 1999 03:26:45 GMT   (3kb)';'   Some physics models have 10 dimensions that are usually decomposed into: 4 spacetime dimensions with local Lorentz Spin(1,3) symmetry plus a 6-dimensional compact space related to internal symmetries. A possibly useful alternative decomposition is into: 6 spacetime dimensions with local Conformal symmetry of the Conformal Group C(1,3) = Spin(2,4) = SU(2,2) plus a 4-dimensional compact Internal Symmetry Space that can be taken to be complex projective 2-space CP2 which, since CP2 = SU(3) / U(2), is a natural representation space for SU(3) and is a natural local representation space for U(2) = SU(2) x U(1).

The 'sewing axiom' of the theory arises as an algebraic pasting law for the determinant of the Dirac operator. We show how representations of the boundary gauge group fit into this description and that this leads to a Fock functor description of certain gauge anomalies. '
9908208;'Dirac Equations, Light Cone Supersymmetry, and Superconformal Algebras';'Lars Brink and P. Ramond';'Tue, 31 Aug 1999 14:20:23 GMT   (14kb)';'   After a brief historical survey that emphasizes the role of the algebra obeyed by the Dirac operator, we examine an algebraic Dirac operator associated with Lie algebras and Lie algebra cosets. For symmetric cosets, its ``massless'' solutions display non-relativistic supersymmetry, and can be identified with the massless degrees of freedom of some supersymmetric theories: N=1 supergravity in eleven dimensions (M-theory), type IIB string theory in ten and four dimensions, and in four dimensions, N=8 supergravity, N=4 super-Yang-Mills, and the N=1 Wess-Zumino multiplet. By generalizing this Dirac operator to the affine case, we generate superconformal algebras associated with cosets ${\bf g}/\bf h$, where $\bf h$ contains the {\it space} little group. Only for eleven dimensional supergravity is $\bf h$ simple. This suggests, albeit in a non-relativistic setting, that these may be the limit of theories with underlying two-dimensional superconformal structure. '
9908209;'On supergravity in (10,2)';'Stephen Hewson';'Tue, 31 Aug 1999 15:05:36 GMT   (14kb)';'   We consider the problem of creating locally supersymmetric theories in signature (10,2). The most natural algebraic starting point is the F-algebra, which is the de Sitter-type (10,2) extension of the super-Poincare algebra. We derive the corresponding geometric group curvatures and evaluate the transformations of the associated gauge fields under the action of an infinitesimal group element. We then discuss the formation of locally supersymmetric actions using these quantities. Due to the absence of any vielbein terms there is no obvious way to define spacetime as such. In addition, there is also no way in which we may naturally construct an action which is linear in the twelve dimensional curvatures. We consider the implications of the simplest possible quadratic theories. We then investigate the relationship between the twelve dimensional theories and Lorentz signature theories in lower dimensions. We argue that in this context the process of dimensional reduction must be replaced by that of group theoretic contraction. Upon contraction a regular spacetime emerges and we find that the twelve dimensional curvature constraint reduces to an Einstein-type equation in which a quadratic non-linearity in the Ricci scalar is suppressed by a factor of the same magnitude as the cosmological constant. Finally, we discuss the degrees of freedom of multi-temporal variables and their relation to ultra-hyperbolic wave equations. '

9909201;'Equivalence Principle, Higher Dimensional Moebius Group and the Hidden';'Gaetano Bertoldi, Alon E. Faraggi and Marco Matone';'Tue, 28 Sep 1999 22:55:38 GMT   (30kb)';'   We show that the recently formulated Equivalence Principle (EP) implies a basic cocycle condition both in Euclidean and Minkowski spaces, which holds in any dimension. This condition, that in one-dimension is sufficient to fix the Schwarzian equation [6], implies a fundamental higher dimensional Moebius invariance which in turn univocally fixes the quantum version of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This holds also in the relativistic case, so that we obtain both the time-dependent Schroedinger equation and the Klein-Gordon equation in any dimension. We then show that the EP implies that masses are related by maps induced by the coordinate transformations connecting different physical systems. Furthermore, we show that the minimal coupling prescription, and therefore gauge invariance, arises quite naturally in implementing the EP. Finally, we show that there is an antisymmetric two-tensor which underlies Quantum Mechanics and sheds new light on the nature of the Quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation. '
9909202;'Monopoles and Dyons in Non-Commutative Geometry';'Akikazu Hashimoto and Koji Hashimoto';'Tue, 28 Sep 1999 22:57:22 GMT   (17kb)';'   Taking advantage of the equivalence between supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on non-commutative spaces and the field theory limit of D3-branes in the background of NSNS 2-form field, we investigate the static properties of magnetic monopoles and dyons using brane construction techniques. When parallel D3-branes are separated by turning on a Higgs vacuum expectation value, D-strings will stretch between them at an angle which depends on the value of the background 2-form potential. These states preserve half of the supersymmetries and have the same masses as their commutative counterparts in the field theory limit. We also find stable (p,q)-dyons and string junctions. We find that they do not preserve any supersymmetry but have the same masses as their commutative counterparts. In the field theory limit, the (p,q)-dyons and the string junctions restore 1/2 and 1/4 of the 16 supersymmetries, respectively. '

The theories under study include QCD within the so-called Method of Field Correlators, QCD-inspired Abelian-projected theories, and compact QED in three and four space-time dimensions. Various nonperturbative properties of the vacua of the above mentioned theories are discussed. The relevance of the Method of Field Correlators to the study of confinement in Abelian models, allowing for an analytical description of this phenomenon, is illustrated by an evaluation of field correlators in these models.

We assume first that the initial state is given and characterized by a density operator equal to a Gaussian density matrix. Then, we study the more realistic situation where only a few expectation values are given at the initial time and we perform an optimization with respect to the initial state. We calculate explicitly the two-time correlation functions with two and four field operators at equilibrium in the symmetric phase. '
9909212;'Mass scales in string and M-theory';'I. Antoniadis';'Wed, 29 Sep 1999 14:11:00 GMT   (46kb)';'   I review the relations between mass scales in various string theories and in M-theory. I discuss physical motivations and possible consistent realizations of large volume compactifications and low string scale. Large longitudinal dimensions, seen by Standard Model particles, imply in general that string theory is strongly coupled unless its tension is close to the compactification scale. Weakly coupled, low-scale strings can in turn be realized only in the presence of extra large transverse dimensions, seen through gravitational interactions, or in the presence of infinitesimal string coupling. In the former case, quantum gravity scale is also low, while in the latter, gravitational and string interactions remain suppressed by the four-dimensional Planck mass. There is one exception in this general rule, allowing for large longitudinal dimensions without low string scale, when Standard Model is embedded in a six-dimensional fixed-point theory described by a tensionless string. Extra dimensions of size as large as TeV$^{-1}\simeq 10^{-16}$ cm are motivated from the problem of supersymmetry breaking in string theory, while TeV scale strings offer a solution to the gauge hierarchy problem, as an alternative to softly broken supersymmetry or technicolor. I discuss these problems in the context of the above mentioned string realizations, as well as the main physical implications both in particle accelerators and in experiments that measure gravity at sub-millimeter distances.

We then use this change of variables to write ordinary abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld action in terms of non-commutative fields. The resulting action is then compared with various low energy contact terms of world-sheet perturbative string scattering amplitudes from non-commutative D$p$-brane. We find completely agreement between the field theory and string theory results. Hence, it shows that perturbative string theory knows the solution of the Seiberg-Witten differential equation. '

We provide evidence that in the presence of a nonzero B field the worldvolume theory of D6 branes decouples from gravity. We analyse the systems of M5 branes and NS5 branes in the presence of a nonzero C field and nonzero RR fields, respectively. Finally, we study the Wilson loops (surfaces) using the dual descriptions.

We consider this function for perturbations of the conformal Yang-Lee model by bulk and boundary fields using conformal perturbation theory, the truncated conformal space approach and the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA). We find that the TBA equations derived by LeClair et al describe the massless boundary flows, up to an overall constant, but are incorrect when one considers a simultaneous bulk perturbation; however the TBA equations do correctly give the `non-universal' linear term in the massive case, and the ratio of g-functions for different boundary conditions is also correctly produced. This ratio is related to the Y-system of the Yang-Lee model and by comparing the perturbative expansions of the Y-system and of the g-functions we obtain the exact relation between the UV and IR parameters of the massless perturbed boundary model.

9909219;'Compactified Little String Theories and Compact Moduli Spaces of Vacua';'Kenneth Intriligator';'Wed, 29 Sep 1999 21:03:20 GMT   (13kb)';'   It is emphasized that compactified little string theories have compact moduli spaces of vacua, which globally probe compact string geometry. Compactifying various little string theories on T^3 leads to 3d theories with exact, quantum Coulomb branch given by: an arbitrary T^4 of volume M_s^2, an arbitrary K3 of volume M_s^2, and moduli spaces of G=SU(N), SO(2N), or E_{6,7,8} instantons on an arbitrary T^4 or K3 of fixed volume. Compactifying instead on a T^2 leads to 4d theories with a compact Coulomb branch base which, when combined with the exact photon gauge coupling fiber, is a compact, elliptically-fibered space related to the above spaces.

9909220;'Remarks on Defining the DLCQ of Quantum Field Theory as a Light-Like';'Adel Bilal (Neuchatel University)';'Thu, 30 Sep 1999 09:11:43 GMT   (27kb)';'   The issue of defining discrete light-cone quantization (DLCQ) in field theory as a light-like limit is investigated. This amounts to studying quantum field theory compactified on a space-like circle of vanishing radius in an appropriate kinematical setting. While this limit is unproblematic at the tree-level, it is non-trivial for loop amplitudes. In one-loop amplitudes, when the propagators are written using standard Feynman $\alpha$-parameters we show that, generically, in the limit of vanishing radius, one of the $\alpha$-integrals is replaced by a discrete sum and the (UV renormalized) one-loop amplitude has a finite light-like limit. This is analogous to what happens in string theory. There are however exceptions and the limit may diverge in certain theories or at higher loop order. We give a rather detailed analysis of the problems one might encounter. We show that quantum electrodynamics at one loop has a well-defined light-like limit. '

9909222;'Probing AdS/CFT correspondence via world-sheet methods and 2d gravity';'Oleg Andreev';'Thu, 30 Sep 1999 12:29:21 GMT   (18kb)';'   We show how some features of the AdS/CFT correspondence for AdS_3 can easily be understood via standard world-sheet methods and 2d gravity like scaling arguments. To do this, we propose a stringy way for perturbing two-dimensional CFT's around their critical points. Our strategy is to start from a stringy (world-sheet) representation of 2d CFT in space-time. Next we perturb a world-sheet action by some marginal operators such that the space-time symmetry becomes finite dimensional. As a result, we get a massive FT in space-time with a scale provided by two-dimensional coupling constant. It turns out that there exists a perturbation that leads to string theory on AdS_3. In this case the scale is equivalently provided by the radial anti-de-Sitter coordinate. '
9909223;'Open group transformations within the Sp(2)-formalism';'Igor Batalin, Robert Marnelius';'Thu, 30 Sep 1999 13:06:34 GMT   (14kb)';'   Previously we have shown that open groups whose generators are in arbitrary involutions may be quantized within a ghost extended framework in terms of the nilpotent BFV-BRST charge operator. Here we show that they may also be quantized within an Sp(2)-frame in which there are two odd anticommuting operators called Sp(2)-charges. Previous results for finite open group transformations are generalized to the Sp(2)-formalism. We show that in order to define open group transformations on the whole ghost extended space we need Sp(2)-charges in the nonminimal sector which contains dynamical Lagrange multipliers. We give an Sp(2)-version of the quantum master equation with extended Sp(2)-charges and a master charge of a more involved form, which is proposed to represent the integrability conditions of defining operators of connection operators and which therefore should encode the generalized quantum  Maurer-Cartan equations for arbitrary open groups. General solutions of this master equation are given in explicit form. A further extended Sp(2)-formalism is proposed in which the group parameters are quadrupled to a supersymmetric set and from which all results may be derived. '

Krichever (Columbia University and Landau Institute for';'Thu, 30 Sep 1999 13:27:39 GMT   (20kb)';'   The action-angle variables for N-particle Hamiltonian system with the Hamiltonian $H=\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \ln sh^{-2}(p_n/2)+\ln(\wp(x_n-x_{n+1})- \wp(x_n+x_{n+1})), x_N=x_0,$ are constructed, and the system is solved in terms of the Riemann $\theta$-functions. It is shown that this system describes pole dynamics of the elliptic solutions of 2D Toda lattice corresponding to spectral curves defined by the equation $w^2-P_{N}^{el}(z)w+\Lambda^{2N}=0$, where $P_{N}^{el}(z)$ is an elliptic function with pole of order N at the point z=0.

9909226;'Monopole and Dyon Solutions in AdS space';'Adrian R. Lugo and Fidel A. Schaposnik';'Thu, 30 Sep 1999 18:45:40 GMT   (13kb)';'   We consider monopole and dyon classical solutions of the Yang-Mills-Higgs system coupled to gravity in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space. We discuss both singular and regular solutions to the second order equations of motion showing that singular Wu-Yang like dyons can be found, the resulting metric being of the Reissner-N\"ordstrom type (with cosmological constant). Concerning regular solutions, we analyze the conditions under which they can be constructed discussing, for vanishing coupling constant, the main distinctive features related to the anti-de Sitter asymptotic condition; in particular, we find in this case that the v.e.v. of the Higgs scalar, $|\vec H(\infty)|$, should be quantized in units of the natural mass scale $1/e r_0$ (related to the cosmological constant) according to $|\vec H(\infty)|^2 = m(m+1) (e r_0 )^{-2}$, with $m \in Z$.

9909227;'Symmetries and interactions in matrix string theory';'Feike Hacquebord';'Thu, 30 Sep 1999 20:12:41 GMT   (174kb)';'   This PhD-thesis reviews matrix string theory and recent developments therein. Emphasis is put on symmetries, interactions and scattering processes in the matrix model. We start with an introduction to matrix string theory and a review of the orbifold model that flows out of matrix string theory in the strong YM coupling limit. Then we turn our attention to the appearance of U-duality symmetry in gauge models, after a (very) short summary of string duality, D-branes and M-theory. The last chapter reviews matrix string interactions and scattering processes in the high energy limit. Also, pair production of D-particles is studied in detail. D-pair production is expected to give important corrections to high energy scattering processes in string theory. '
9909228;'Superconformal Hypermultiplets';'Bernard de Wit, Bas Kleijn and Stefan Vandoren';'Thu, 30 Sep 1999 19:53:54 GMT   (30kb)';'   We present theories of N=2 hypermultiplets in four spacetime dimensions that are invariant under rigid or local superconformal symmetries. The target spaces of theories with rigid superconformal invariance are (4n)-dimensional {\it special} hyper-K\"ahler manifolds. Such manifolds can be described as cones over tri-Sasakian metrics and are locally the product of a flat four-dimensional space and a quaternionic manifold. The latter manifolds appear in the coupling of hypermultiplets to N=2 supergravity. We employ local sections of an Sp$(n)\times{\rm Sp}(1)$ bundle in the formulation of the Lagrangian and transformation rules, thus allowing for arbitrary coordinatizations of the hyper-K\"ahler and quaternionic manifolds.

9909229;'Heterotic String Conformal Field Theory And A-D-E Singularities';'Edward Witten';'Thu, 30 Sep 1999 20:55:21 GMT   (22kb)';'   We analyze the behavior of the heterotic string near an A-D-E singularity without small instantons. This problem is governed by a strongly coupled worldsheet conformal field theory, which, by a combination of O(alpha') corrections and worldsheet instantons, smooths out the singularities present in the classical geometry.

9910201;'Cohomological analysis of gauged-fixed gauge theories';'Glenn Barnich, Marc Henneaux, Tobias Hurth and Kostas Skenderis';'Tue, 26 Oct 1999 10:01:47 GMT   (17kb)';'   The relation between the gauge-invariant local BRST cohomology involving the antifields and the gauge-fixed BRST cohomology is clarified. It is shown in particular that the cocycle conditions become equivalent once it is imposed, on the gauge-fixed side, that the BRST cocycles should yield deformations that preserve the nilpotency of the (gauge-fixed) BRST differential. This shows that the restrictions imposed on local counterterms by the Quantum Noether condition in the Epstein--Glaser construction of gauge theories are equivalent to the restrictions imposed by BRST invariance on local counterterms in the standard Lagrangian approach.

9910202;'Radius Stabilization and Anomaly-Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking';'Markus A. Luty and Raman Sundrum';'Tue, 26 Oct 1999 13:10:28 GMT   (26kb)';'   We analyze in detail a specific 5-dimensional realization of a "brane-universe" scenario where the visible and hidden sectors are localized on spatially separated 3-branes coupled only by supergravity, with supersymmetry breaking originating in the hidden sector. Although general power counting allows order 1/M_{Planck}^2 contact terms between the two sectors in the 4-dimensional theory from exchange of supergravity Kaluza-Klein modes, we show that they are not present by carefully matching to the 5-dimensional theory. We also find that the radius modulus corresponding to the size of the compactified dimension must be stabilized by additional dynamics in order to avoid run-away behavior after supersymmetry breaking and to understand the communication of supersymmetry breaking. We stabilize the radius by adding two pure Yang--Mills sectors, one in the bulk and the other localized on a brane. Gaugino condensation in the 4-dimensional effective theory generates a superpotential that can naturally fix the radius at a sufficiently large value that supersymmetry breaking is communicated dominantly by the recently-discovered mechanism of anomaly mediation. The mass of the radius modulus is large compared to m_{3/2}. The stabilization mechanism requires only parameters of order one at the fundamental scale, with no fine-tuning except for the cosmological constant. '
9910205;'Vertex Operators for AdS3 Background With Ramond Ramond Flux';'Louise Dolan and Edward Witten';'Tue, 26 Oct 1999 16:17:33 GMT   (18kb)';'   In order to study vertex operators for the Type IIB superstring on AdS space, we derive supersymmetric constraint equations for the vertex operators in AdS3xS3 backgrounds with Ramond-Ramond flux, using Berkovits-Vafa-Witten variables. These constraints are solved to compute the vertex operators and show that they satisfy the linearized D=6, N=(2,0) equations of motion for a supergravity and tensor multiplet expanded around the AdS3xS3 spacetime.

9910206;'A Finite Dimensional Gauge Problem in the WZNW Model';'M. Dubois-Violette, P. Furlan, L.K. Hadjiivanov, A.P. Isaev, P.N.';'Tue, 26 Oct 1999 16:21:20 GMT   (21kb)';'   The left and right zero modes of the level k SU(n) WZNW model give rise to a pair of isomorphic (left and right) mutually commuting quantum matrix algebras. For a deformation parameter q being an even (2h-th, h = k + n) root of unity each of these matrix algebras admits an ideal such that the corresponding factor algebra is finite dimensional. The structure of superselection sectors of the (diagonal) 2D WZNW model is then reduced to a finite dimensional problem of a gauge theory type. For n=2 this problem is solved using a generalized BRS formalism. '
9910207;'On the Heterotic/F-Theory Duality in Eight Dimensions';'W. Lerche';'Tue, 26 Oct 1999 16:26:57 GMT   (211kb)';'   We review quantitative tests on the duality between the heterotic string on T^2 and F-theory on K3. On the heterotic side, certain threshold corrections to the effective action can be exactly computed at one-loop order, and the issue is to reproduce these from geometric quantities pertaining to the K3 surface. In doing so we learn about certain non-perturbative interactions of 7-branes. '
9910208;'Domain walls in supersymmetric QCD';'B. de Carlos, J.M.

In particular, for N > 3 we explicitly construct the elementary domain wall that interpolates between two contiguous vacua. We show that these solutions are BPS saturated for any value of the mass of the matter fields. We also comment on their large N limit and their relevance for supersymmetric gluodynamics. '

9910210;'Twisted Boundary Conditions and Matching to the Effective Four';'T.E. Clark and S.T. Love';'Tue, 26 Oct 1999 18:22:00 GMT   (7kb)';'   Nontrivial twisted boundary conditions associated with extra compact dimensions produce an ambiguity in the value of the four dimensional coupling constants of the renormalizable interactions of the twisted fields' zero modes. Resolving this indeterminancy would require a knowledge of the exact form of the higher dimensional action including the coefficients of higher dimensional operators. For the case of moderately sized extra dimensions, the uncertainty in the coupling constants can be of order one and may lead to modifications in the stability of the model. '

9910214;'Algebraic Aspects of Interactions of Massive Spinning Particles in Three';'K.B. Alkalaev and S.L. Lyakhovich (Tomsk State University, Russia)';'Wed, 27 Oct 1999 06:01:21 GMT   (9kb)';'   The most general 2+1 dimensional spinning particle model is considered. The action functional may involve all the possible first order Poincare invariants of world lines, and the particular class of actions is specified thus the corresponding gauge algebra to be unbroken by inhomogeneous external fields. Nevertheless, the consistency problem reveals itself as a requirement of the global compatibility between first and second class constraints. These compatibility conditions, being unnoticed before in realistic second class theories, can be satisfied for a particle iff the gyromagnetic ratio takes the critical value g=2. The quantization procedure is suggested for a particle in the generic background field by making use of a Darboux co-ordinates, being found by a perturbative expansion in the field multipoles and the general procedure is described for constructing of the respective transformation in any order.

9910216;'Non-perturbative N=1 strings from geometric singularities';'P. Mayr';'Wed, 27 Oct 1999 09:48:52 GMT   (31kb)';'   The study of curved D-brane geometries in type II strings implies a general relation between local singularities $\cx W$ of Calabi-Yau manifolds and gravity free supersymmetric QFT's. The minimal supersymmetric case is described by F-theory compactifications on $\cx W$ and can be used as a starting point to define minimal supersymmetric heterotic string compactifications on compact Calabi-Yau manifolds with holomorphic, stable gauge backgrounds. The geometric construction generalizes to non-perturbative vacua with five-branes and provides a framework to study non-perturbative dynamics of the heterotic theory. '
9910217;'Non-BPS States and Heterotic - Type I' Duality';'T. Dasgupta and B. Stefanski Jr';'Wed, 27 Oct 1999 11:39:54 GMT   (16kb)';'   There are two families of non-BPS bi-spinors in the perturbative spectrum of the nine dimensional heterotic string charged under the gauge group $SO(16)\times SO(16)$. The relation between these perturbative non-BPS states and certain non-perturbative non-BPS D-brane states of the dual type I$^\prime$ theory is exhibited. The relevant branes include a $\Zop_2$ charged non-BPS D-string, and a bound state of such a D-string with a fundamental string. The domains of stability of these states as well as their decay products in both theories are determined and shown to agree with the duality map. '

These theories are unitary in the usual S S^\dagger =1 sense, they are not parity invariant, and they exhibit continuous coupling constants that determine both the mass spectrum of stable particles and the masses and the position of the resonance poles.

9910219;'Brane cosmological evolution in a bulk with cosmological constant';'Pierre Binetruy, Cedric Deffayet, Ulrich Ellwanger (LPTHE, Orsay),';'Wed, 27 Oct 1999 22:21:44 GMT   (10kb)';'   We consider the cosmology of a ``3-brane universe'' in a five dimensional (bulk) space-time with a cosmological constant. We show that Einstein's equations admit a first integral, analogous to the first Friedmann equation, which governs the evolution of the metric in the brane, whatever the time evolution of the metric along the fifth dimension. We thus obtain the cosmological evolution in the brane for any equation of state describing the matter in the brane, without needing the dependence of the metric on the fifth dimension. In the particular case $p = w \rho$, $(w = constant)$, we give explicit expressions for the time evolution of the brane scale factor, which show that standard cosmological evolution can be obtained (after an early non conventional phase) in a scenario \`a la Randall and Sundrum, where a brane tension compensates the bulk cosmological constant. We also show that a tiny deviation from exact compensation leads to an effective cosmological constant at late time. Moreover, when the metric along the fifth dimension is static, we are able to extend the solution found on the brane to the whole spacetime. '
9910220;'A New Superconformal Mechanics';'E.Deotto, G.Furlan, E.Gozzi';'Wed, 27 Oct 1999 14:19:54 GMT   (24kb)';'   In this paper we propose a new supersymmetric extension of conformal mechanics. The Grassmannian variables that we introduce are the basis of the forms and of the vector-fields built over the symplectic space of the original system. Our supersymmetric Hamiltonian itself turns out to have a clear geometrical meaning being the Lie-derivative of the Hamiltonian flow of conformal mechanics. Using superfields we derive a constraint which gives the exact solution of the supersymmetric system in a way analogous to the constraint in configuration space which solved the original non-supersymmetric model. Besides the supersymmetric extension of the original Hamiltonian, we also provide the extension of the other conformal generators present in the original system. These extensions have also a supersymmetric character being the square of some Grassmannian charge. We build the whole superalgebra of these charges and analyze their closure. The representation of the even part of this superalgebra on the odd part turns out to be integer and not spinorial in character. '
9910221;'A Model for Topological Fermions';'Manfried Faber';'Wed, 27 Oct 1999 14:28:35 GMT   (38kb)';'   We introduce a model designed to describe charged particles as stable topological solitons of a field with values on the internal space S^3. These solitons behave like particles with relativistic properties like Lorentz contraction and velocity dependence of mass. This mass is defined by the energy of the soliton. In this sense this model is a generalisation of the sine-Gordon model from 1+1 dimensions to 3+1 dimensions, from S^1 to S^3. (We do not chase the aim to give a four-dimensional generalisation of Coleman's isomorphism between the Sine-Gordon model and the Thirring model which was shown in 2-dimensional space-time.) For large distances from the center of solitons this model tends to a dual U(1)-theory with freely propagating electromagnetic waves. Already at the classical level it describes important effects, which usually have to be explained by quantum field theory, like particle-antiparticle annihilation and the running of the coupling. '
9910222;'SDLCQ: Supersymmetric Discrete Light Cone Quantization';'O. Lunin, S. Pinsky';'Wed, 27 Oct 1999 16:30:45 GMT   (169kb)';'   In these lectures we discuss the application of discrete light cone quantization (DLCQ) to supersymmetric field theories. We will see that it is possible to formulate DLCQ so that supersymmetry is exactly preserved in the discrete approximation. We call this formulation of DLCQ, SDLCQ and it combines the power of DLCQ with all of the beauty of supersymmetry. In these lecture we will review the application of SDLCQ to several interesting supersymmetric theories. We will discuss two dimensional theories with (1,1), (2,2) and (8,8) supersymmetry, zero modes, vacuum degeneracy, massless states, mass gaps, theories in higher dimensions, and the Maldacena conjecture among other subjects.

Then, using the Itzykson-Zuber integral at the large-N limit, it is found that the classical Young tableau density, which satisfies the saddle-point equation and determines the large-N limit of free energy, is the inverse of the solution of this generalized Hopf equation, at a certain point.

9910228;'Discrete torsion in non-geometric orbifolds and their open-string';'Massimo Bianchi, Jose' F. Morales and Gianfranco Pradisi (Dipartimento';'Thu, 28 Oct 1999 13:18:45 GMT   (23kb)';'   We discuss some Z_N^L x Z_N^R orbifold compactifications of the type IIB superstring to D= 4,6 dimensions and their type I descendants. Although the Z_N^L x Z_N^R generators act asymmetrically on the chiral string modes, they result into left-right symmetric models that admit sensible unorientable reductions. We carefully work out the phases that appear in the modular transformations of the chiral amplitudes and identify the possibility of introducing discrete torsion. We propose a simplifying ansatz for the construction of the open-string descendants in which the transverse-channel Klein-bottle, annulus and Moebius-strip amplitudes are numerically identical in the proper parametrization of the world-sheet. A simple variant of the ansatz for the Z_2^L x Z_2^R orbifold gives rise to models with supersymmetry breaking in the open-string sector. '
9910229;'On heavy states in supersymmetric gluodynamics at large N';'A. Gorsky and K.

These states exist in the form of quantum bubbles made out of the BPS domain walls. Analogous states are likely to exist in non-supersymmetric case as well. '

For the axial anomaly all new terms introduced by the non locality can be brought to the standard minimal Bardeen's form. Some extensions of the present techniques are also commented. '

It has a number of appealing features: i) its quantum geometry is non-fractal, ii) it remains consistent when coupled to matter, even beyond the c=1 barrier, iii) it is closer to canonical quantization approaches than previous path-integral formulations, and iv) its construction generalizes to higher dimensions.

9910235;'Solution Generating in Ten Dimensional Supersymmetric Classical';'Jean-Loup Gervais';'Thu, 28 Oct 1999 16:47:16 GMT   (14kb)';'   In a recent paper (hep-th/9811108), Saveliev and the author showed that there exits an on-shell light cone gauge where the non-linear part of the field equations reduces to a (super) version of Yang's equations which may be solved by methods inspired by the ones previously developed for self-dual Yang-Mills equations in four dimensions. Later on (hep-th/9903218), the analogy between these latter theories and the present ones was pushed further by writing down a set of super partial linear differential equations which are the analogues of the Lax pair of Belavin and Zakharov. Using this Lax representation, it is shown in the present article that solution-generating techniques are at work, which are similar to the ones developed for four dimensional self-dual Yang-Mills theories in the late seventies.

9910236;'Effects in Gauge Theories and a Harmonic Function on $E_{10}$';'Ori J. Ganor';'Thu, 28 Oct 1999 18:28:39 GMT   (33kb)';'   In a previous paper we conjectured that the structure of various gauge theories as well as M-theory on $T^8$ is encoded in a unique function $\Xi$ on the coset $E_{10}(Z)\backslash E_{10}(R)/K$ and that this function is harmonic with respect to the $E_{10}(R)$ invariant metric. In this paper we elaborate on the conjecture. We discuss various mass deformations of the D-instanton integral and their realizations in $\Xi$. We then present a conjectured prescription for extracting partition functions of the twisted little-string theory out of $\Xi$. We also study various effects of combinations of branes such as D0-branes near D4-branes with 2-form flux, D-instantons near Taub-NUT metrics, and more, in terms of harmonic functions on $E_d(R)/K$. We propose tests of the conjecture that are related to BPS states of global symmetries in gauge theories. '
9910237;'Regular R-R and NS-NS BPS black holes';'M. Bertolini, M. Trigiante';'Thu, 28 Oct 1999 18:08:46 GMT   (19kb)';'   We show in a precise group theoretical fashion how the generating solution of regular BPS black holes of N=8 supergravity, which is known to be a solution also of a simpler N=2 STU model truncation, can be characterized as NS-NS or R-R charged according to the way the corresponding STU model is embedded in the original N=8 theory. Of particular interest is the class of embeddings which yield regular BPS black hole solutions carrying only R-R charge and whose microscopic description can possibly be given in terms of bound states of D-branes only. The microscopic interpretation of the bosonic fields in this class of STU models relies on the solvable Lie algebra (SLA) method. In the present article we improve this mathematical technique in order to provide two distinct descriptions for type IIA and type IIB theories and an algebraic characterization of S*T--dual embeddings within the N=8,d=4 theory. This analysis will be applied to the particular example of a four parameter (dilatonic) solution of which both the full macroscopic and microscopic descriptions will be worked out. '
9910238;'Hypermultiplet Moduli Space and Three Dimensional Gauge Theories';'Moshe Rozali';'Thu, 28 Oct 1999 18:29:00 GMT   (7kb)';'   We establish a relation, conjectured recently by E. Witten, between the hypermultiplet moduli space in compactifications of the heterotic string on an A-D-E singularities, and the moduli spaces of three dimensional pure gauge theories with the corresponding A-D-E gauge groups. It is possible to add a bounded number of heterotic fivebranes sitting in the singularity, while (in leading order in $\alpha'$) keeping the heterotic string perturbative. The corresponding hypermultiplet moduli space is given by the moduli space of a three dimensional gauge theory with matter. '
9910239;'A new topological aspect of the arbitrary dimensional topological';'Ying Jiang, Yishi Duan';'Fri, 29 Oct 1999 01:50:49 GMT   (30kb)';'   We present a new generalized topological current in terms of the order parameter field $\vec \phi$ to describe the arbitrary dimensional topological defects. By virtue of the $% \phi$-mapping method, we show that the topological defects are generated from the zero points of the order parameter field $\vec \phi$, and the topological charges of these topological defects are topological quantized in terms of the Hopf indices and Brouwer degrees of $\phi$-mapping under the condition that the Jacobian $% J(\frac \phi v)\neq 0$. When $J(\frac \phi v)=0$, it is shown that there exist the crucial case of branch process. Based on the implicit function theorem and the Taylor expansion, we detail the bifurcation of generalized topological current and find different directions of the bifurcation. The arbitrary dimensional topological defects are found splitting or merging at the degenerate point of field function $\vec \phi $ but the total charge of the topological defects is still unchanged.

9910240;'The Parisi-Sourlas Mechanism in Yang-Mills Theory?';'Jose A. Magpantay (National Institute of Physics, U.P. Diliman Q.C.,';'Fri, 29 Oct 1999 03:48:16 GMT   (16kb)';'   The Parisi-Sourlas mechanism is exhibited in pure Yang-Mills theory. Using the new scalar degrees of freedom derived from the non-linear gauge condition, we show that the non-perturbative sector of Yang-Mills theory is equivalent to a 4D O(1,3) sigma model in a random field. We then show that the leading term of this equivalent theory is invariant under supersymmetry transformations where (x^{2}+\thetabar\theta) is unchanged. This leads to dimensional reduction proving the equivalence of the non-perturbative sector of Yang-Mills theory to a 2D O(1,3) sigma model. '

9910242;'Minimal String Driven Cosmology and its Predictions';'M. P. Infante, N. Sanchez';'Fri, 29 Oct 1999 14:09:39 GMT   (22kb)';'   We present a minimal model for the Universe evolution fully extracted from effective String Theory. By linking this model with a minimal but well established observational information, we prove that it gives realistic predictions on early and current energy density and its results are compatible with General Relativity. Interestingly enough, the predicted current energy density is found $\Omega = 1$ and in anycase with lower limit $\Omega \geq {4/9}$. On the other hand, the energy density at the exit of inflationary stage gives also $\Omega|_{inf}=1$. This result shows an agreement with General Relativity (spatially flat metric gives critical energy density) within an unequivalent Non-Einstenian context (string low energy effective equations). The order of magnitude of the energy density-dilaton coupled term at the beginning of radiation dominated stage agrees with GUT scale. Without solving the known problems about higher order corrections and graceful exit of inflation, we find this model closer to the observational Universe properties than the current available string cosmology scenarii. At a more fundamental level, this model is by its construction close to the standard cosmological evolution, and it is driven selfconsistently by the evolution of the string equation of state itself. The inflationary String Driven stage is able to reach an enough amount of inflation, describing a Big Bang like evolution for the metric. '

9910244;'Black Hole Thermodynamics and Two-Dimensional Dilaton Gravity Theory';'Donam Youm';'Fri, 29 Oct 1999 16:29:01 GMT   (12kb)';'   We relate various black hole solutions in the near-horizon region to black hole solutions in two-dimensional dilaton gravity theories in order to argue that thermodynamics of black holes in D>=4 can be effectively described by thermodynamics of black holes in two-dimensional dilaton gravity theories. We show that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropies of single-charged dilatonic black holes and dilatonic p-branes with an arbitrary dilaton coupling parameter in arbitrary spacetime dimensions are exactly reproduced by the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the two-dimensional black hole in the associated two-dimensional dilaton gravity model. We comment that thermodynamics of non-extreme stringy four-dimensional black hole with four charges and five-dimensional black hole with three charges may be effectively described by thermodynamics of the black hole solutions with constant dilaton field in two-dimensional dilaton gravity theories.

9910246;'Abelian Vectors and Self-Dual Tensors in Six-Dimensional Supergravity';'Fabio Riccioni';'Fri, 29 Oct 1999 18:03:38 GMT   (8kb)';'   In this note we describe the most general coupling of {\it abelian} vector and tensor multiplets to six-dimensional $(1,0)$ supergravity. As was recently pointed out, it is of interest to consider more general Chern-Simons couplings to abelian vectors of the type $H^{r}=d B^{r}-1/2 c^{rab} A^{a}d A^{b}$, with $c^{r}$ matrices that may not be simultaneously diagonalized. We show that these couplings can be related to Green-Schwarz terms of the form $B^r c_r^{ab} F^a F^b$, and how the complete local Lagrangian, that embodies factorized gauge and supersymmetry anomalies (to be disposed of by fermion loops) is uniquely determined by Wess-Zumino consistency conditions, aside from an arbitrary quartic coupling for the gauginos.

9910248;'Heterotic String Corrections from the Dual Type II String';'Paul S. Aspinwall and M. Ronen Plesser';'Fri, 29 Oct 1999 19:15:47 GMT   (27kb)';'   We introduce a method of using the a dual type IIA string to compute alpha'-corrections to the moduli space of heterotic string compactifications. In particular we study the hypermultiplet moduli space of a heterotic string on a K3 surface. One application of this machinery shows that type IIB strings compactified on a Calabi-Yau space suffer from worldsheet instantons, spacetime instantons and, in addition, "mixed" instantons which in a sense are both worldsheet and spacetime. As another application we look at the hyperkaehler limit of the moduli space in which the K3 surface becomes an ALE space. This is a variant of the "geometric engineering" method used for vector multiplet moduli space and should be applicable to a wide range of examples. In particular we reproduce Sen and Witten's result for the heterotic string on an A1 singularity and a trivial bundle and generalize this to a collection of E8 point-like instantons on an ALE space.

9910249;'Non-BPS Branes on a Calabi-Yau Threefold and Bose-Fermi Degeneracy';'Mihail Mihailescu, Kyungho Oh and Radu Tatar';'Fri, 29 Oct 1999 22:41:32 GMT   (13kb)';'   We consider the spectrum of open strings for non-BPS D-brane configuration in type II string theory on a Calabi-Yau threefold. In general, there is no degeneracy between bosonic and fermionic states. However we find special values for the moduli space of Calabi-Yau threefolds there are non-BPS brane configurations which have an exact degeneracy between bosonic and fermionic states. For these values there is no force between pairs of non-BPS D-branes. This gives rise to a possibility of building diverse non-supersymmetric gauge field theories on the brane world-volume. We use the approach recently elaborated by Gaberdiel and Sen. '
9910250;'On Inherited Duality in N=1 d=4 Supersymmetric Gauge Theories';'Philip C. Argyres (Cornell, ITP Santa Barbara), Ken Intriligator (UC';'Fri, 29 Oct 1999 21:44:34 GMT   (13kb)';'   Four-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories with two adjoints and a quartic superpotential are believed, from AdS/CFT duality, to have SL(2,Z) invariance. In this note we review an old, unpublished argument for this property, based solely on field theory. The technique involves a complexified flavor rotation which deforms an N=2 supersymmetric gauge theory with matter to an N=1 theory, leaving all holomorphic invariants unchanged. We apply this to the N=1 gauge theory with two massless adjoints and show that it has the same auxiliary torus as that of N=4 gauge theory, from which SL(2,Z) invariance follows. In an appendix, we check that our arguments are consistent with earlier work on the SU(2) case. Our technique is general and applies to many other N=1 theories. '
9910251;'Quantization of the Superstring in Ramond-Ramond Backgrounds';'Nathan Berkovits (IFT/UNESP, Sao Paulo)';'Fri, 29 Oct 1999 22:38:06 GMT   (10kb)';'   Sigma model actions are constructed for the Type II superstring compactified to four and six dimensional curved backgrounds which can contain non-vanishing Ramond-Ramond fields. These actions are N=2 worldsheet superconformally invariant and can be covariantly quantized preserving manifest spacetime supersymmetry. They are constructed using a hybrid version of superstring variables which combines features of the Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz and Green-Schwarz formalisms. For the $AdS_2\times S^2$ and $AdS_3\times S^3$ backgrounds, these actions differ from the classical Greeen-Schwarz actions by a crucial kinetic term for the fermions. Parts of this work have been done in collaborations with M. Bershadsky, T. Hauer, W. Siegel, C. Vafa, E. Witten, S. Zhukov and B. Zwiebach. '
9910252;'Four-dimensional N=4 SO(4) Gauged Supergravity from D=11';'M. Cvetic, H. Lu and C.N. Pope';'Mon, 1 Nov 1999 23:44:57 GMT   (20kb)';'   We construct the complete and explicit non-linear Kaluza-Klein Ansatz for deriving the bosonic sector of the standard N=4 SO(4) gauged four-dimensional supergravity from the reduction of D=11 supergravity on S^7. This provides a way of interpreting all bosonic solutions of the four-dimensional gauged theory as exact solutions in eleven-dimensional supergravity. We discuss certain limiting forms of the Kaluza-Klein reduction, and compare them with related forms in the Freedman-Schwarz N=4 SU(2)xSU(2) gauged theory. This leads us to the result that the Freedman-Schwarz model is in fact a singular limiting case of the standard SO(4) gauged supergravity. We show that in this limit, our Ansatz for getting the SO(4) gauged theory as an S^7 reduction from D=11 indeed reduces to an S^3 x S^3 reduction from D=10, which makes contact with previous results in the literature. We also show that there is no distinction to be made between having equal or unequal values for the gauge coupling constants $g$ and $\tilde g$ of the two SU(2) gauge-group factors in the standard N=4 SO(4) gauged supergravity, whilst by contrast the ratio of $g$ to $\tilde g$ is a non-trivial parameter of the Freedman-Schwarz model.

9910256;'Exact Renormalization Group and Loop Equation';'Shinji Hirano';'Sun, 31 Oct 1999 07:04:48 GMT   (12kb)';'   We propose a gauge invariant formulation of the exact renormalization group equation for nonsupersymmetric pure U(N) Yang-Mills theory, based on the construction by Tim Morris. In fact we show that our renormalization group equation amounts to a regularized version of the loop equation, thereby providing a direct relation between the exact renormalization group and the Schwinger-Dyson equations. We also discuss a possible implication of our formulation to the holographic correspondence of the bulk gravity and the boundary gauge theory. '
9910257;'Non-renormalizability of a SSB gauge theory induced by a non-linear';'Nistor Nicolaevici';'Sun, 31 Oct 1999 22:08:31 GMT   (127kb)';'   We consider an abelian gauge theory with spontaneously broken symmetry containing a scalar-fermion coupling which is non-linear in the Higgs field. Although in the unitary gauge it reduces to a pure Yukawa term, suggesting that the theory is renormalizable, the one loop divergence structure in this gauge in the fermion-fermion elastic scattering amplitude shows this is not so. Comparison is made with the theory with a conventional coupling, for which cancellation of the non-renormalizable divergences occurs. '

The spectrum of twisted modes at the singularity contains tachyonic modes. We show that, in certain parameter region, this tachyonic spectrum is completely reproduced as modes of the bulk tachyon field localized on a classical NS5-brane solution. In passing, we show how twisted modes at the singularity reproduce gauge fields on stacks of NS5-branes. '
9910261;'Genuine Dyons in Born-Infeld Electrodynamics';'Hongsu Kim';'Mon, 1 Nov 1999 06:33:31 GMT   (13kb)';'   Study of magnetic monopoles in the original version of Born-Infeld (BI) electrodynamics is performed. It then is realized that interesting new physics emerge and they include exotic behavior of radial electric monopole field such as its regularity as $r\to 0$ and its changing behavior with the absence or presence of the radial magnetic monopole field. This last point has been interpreted as the manifestation of the existence of point-like dyons in abelian BI theory. Two pieces of clear evidences in favor of this dyon interpretation are provided. It is also demonstrated that despite these unique features having no analogues in standard Maxwell theory, the cherished Dirac quantisation condition remains unchanged. Lastly, comments are given concerning that dyons found here in the original version of BI electrodynamics should be distinguished from the ones with the same name or BIons being studied in the recent literature on D-brane physics.

9910262;'Scaling Behaviors of Branched Polymers';'Hajime Aoki, Satoshi Iso, Hikaru Kawai and Yoshihisa Kitazawa';'Mon, 1 Nov 1999 09:19:57 GMT   (19kb)';'   We study the thermodynamic behavior of branched polymers. We first study random walks in order to clarify the thermodynamic relation between the canonical ensemble and the grand canonical ensemble. We then show that correlation functions for branched polymers are given by those for $\phi^3$ theory with a single mass insertion, not those for the $\phi^3$ theory themselves. In particular, the two-point function behaves as $1/p^4$, not as $1/p^2$, in the scaling region. This behavior is consistent with the fact that the Hausdorff dimension of the branched polymer is four. '

We derive properties concerning with the noncommutativity of D-brane worldvolume, the Green functions and the spectrum of this system. In the zero slope limit, a large number of light states appear as the lowest excitations in appropriate cases. We are able to relate the energies of the lowest states after the GSO projection with the configurations of branes at angles. Through analytic continuation, the system is compared with the branes with relative motion. '
9910264;'Nonabelian Duality and Solvable Large N Lattice Systems';'Andrey Dubin';'Mon, 1 Nov 1999 15:28:14 GMT   (38kb)';'   We introduce the basics of the nonabelian duality transformation of SU(N) or U(N) vector-field models defined on a lattice. The dual degrees of freedom are certain species of the integer-valued fields complemented by the symmetric groups' \otimes_{n} S(n) variables. While the former parametrize relevant irreducible representations, the latter play the role of the Lagrange multipliers facilitating the fusion rules involved. As an application, I construct a novel solvable family of SU(N) D-matrix systems graded by the rank 1\leq{k}\leq{(D-1)} of the manifest [U(N)]^{\oplus k} conjugation-symmetry. Their large N solvability is due to a hidden invariance (explicit in the dual formulation) which allows for a mapping onto the recently proposed eigenvalue-models \cite{Dub1} with the largest k=D symmetry. Extending \cite{Dub1}, we reconstruct a D-dimensional gauge theory with the large N free energy given (modulo the volume factor) by the free energy of a given proposed 1\leq{k}\leq{(D-1)} D-matrix system. It is emphasized that the developed formalism provides with the basis for higher-dimensional generalizations of the Gross-Taylor stringy representation of strongly coupled 2d gauge theories. '
9910265;'Integral representation for the eigenfunctions of quantum periodic Toda';'S. Kharchev, D. Lebedev';'Mon, 1 Nov 1999 15:43:24 GMT   (21kb)';'   Integral representation for the eigenfunctions of quantum periodic Toda chain is constructed for N-particle case. The multiple integral is calculated using the Cauchy residue formula. This gives the representation which reproduces the particular results obtained by Gutzwiller for N=2,3 and 4-particle chain. Our method to solve the problem combines the ideas of Gutzwiller and R-matrix approach of Sklyanin with the classical results in the theory of the Whittaker functions. In particular, we calculate Sklyanin's invariant scalar product from the Plancherel formula for the Whittaker functions derived by Semenov-Tian-Shansky thus obtaining the natural interpretation of the Sklyanin measure in terms of the Harish-Chandra function.

The classification of all the possibilities, consistent with the structure of the theory, is achieved by studying the Wess-Zumino terms in the worldvolume effective actions of the branes of M-theory and their reductions.

9910268;'Conformal Field Theories on K3 and Three-Dimensional Gauge Theories';'P. Mayr';'Mon, 1 Nov 1999 23:53:16 GMT   (16kb)';'   According to a recent conjecture, the moduli space of the heterotic conformal field theory on a $G\subset$ ADE singularity of an ALE space is equivalent to the moduli space of a pure $\cx N=4$ supersymmetric three-dimensional gauge theory with gauge group G. We establish this relation using geometric engineering of heterotic strings and generalize it to theories with non-trivial matter content. A similar equivalence is found between the moduli of heterotic CFT on isolated Calabi--Yau 3-fold singularities and two-dimensional Kazama-Suzuki coset theories. '

In particular, stability of the brane under collision with ultra-relativistic particles is discussed. As a toy model we consider the 3 dimensional version of the Randall and Sundrum solution and show that stability of the brane depends on a choice of continuation of the solution across the horizon. In the unstable case black holes can be produced in the collision of a particle with the brane. '

In particular, we describe the key features of Scherk-Schwarz deformations in type I models and conclude by reviewing the phenomenon of ``brane supersymmetry breaking'': the tadpole conditions of some type-I models require that supersymmetry be {\it broken at the string scale} on a collection of branes, while being exact, to lowest order, in the bulk and on other branes.

9911206;'Nonlinear Instantons from Supersymmetric p-Branes';'Marcos Marino, Ruben Minasian, Gregory Moore, Andrew Strominger';'Thu, 25 Nov 1999 16:15:38 GMT   (31kb)';'   Supersymmetric configurations of type II D-branes with nonzero gauge field strengths in general supersymmetric backgrounds with nonzero B fields are analyzed using the kappa-symmetric worldvolume action. It is found in dimension four or greater that the usual instanton equation for the gauge field obtains a nonlinear deformation. The deformation is parameterized by the topological data of the B-field, the background geometry and the cycle wrapped by the brane. In the appropriate dimensions, limits and settings these equations reduce to deformed instanton equations recently found in the context of noncommutative geometry as well as those following from Lagrangians based on Bott-Chern forms. We further consider instantons comprised of M5-branes wrapping a Calabi-Yau space with non-vanishing three-form field strengths. It is shown that the instanton equations for the three-form are related to the Kodaira-Spencer equations. '
9911207;'Two-Loop Quark Self-Energy in a New Formalism (II): Renormalization of';'George Leibbrandt, Jimmy D. Williams';'Thu, 25 Nov 1999 17:22:46 GMT   (212kb)';'   The complete two-loop correction to the quark propagator, consisting of the spider, rainbow, gluon bubble and quark bubble diagrams, is evaluated in the noncovariant light-cone gauge (lcg). (The overlapping self-energy diagram had already been computed.) The chief technical tools include the powerful matrix integration technique, the n^*-prescription for the spurious poles of 1/qn, and the detailed analysis of the boundary singularities in five- and six-dimensional parameter space. It is shown that the total divergent contribution to the two-loop correction Sigma_2 contains both covariant and noncovariant components, and is a local function of the external momentum p, even off the mass-shell, as all nonlocal divergent terms cancel exactly. Consequently, both the quark mass and field renormalizations are local. The structure of Sigma_2 implies a quark mass counterterm of the form $\delta m (lcg) = m\tilde\alpha_s C_F(3+\tilde\alpha_sW) + {\rm O} (\tilde\alpha_s^3)$, $\tilde\alpha_s = g^2\Gamma(\eps)(4\pi)^{\eps -2}$, with W depending only on the dimensional regulator epsilon, and on the numbers of colors and flavors. It turns out that \delta m(lcg) is identical to the mass counterterm in the general linear covariant gauge. Our results are in agreement with the Bassetto-Dalbosco-Soldati renormalization scheme. '

Working in the framework of split dimensional regularization, with complex regulating parameters \sigma and n/2-\sigma for the energy and space components of the loop momentum, respectively, we find that split dimensional regularization leads to well-defined two-loop integrals, and that the overall coefficient of the leading pole term for \Sigma(p) is strictly local. Extensive tables showing the pole parts of one- and two-loop Coulomb integrals are given. We also comment on some general implications of split dimensional regularization, discussing in particular the limit \sigma \to 1/2 and the subleading terms in the epsilon-expansion of noncovariant integrals.

9911214;'Gauge Invariance of the Quantum Electrodynamics in the Causal Approach';'Dan Radu Grigore';'Fri, 26 Nov 1999 11:11:42 GMT   (28kb)';'   We present an extremely simple solution to the renormalization of quantum electrodynamics based on Epstein-Glaser approach to renormalization theory. '
9911215;'The Renormalization Group Approach to the Confining String';'Enrique Alvarez and C\'esar G\'omez';'Fri, 26 Nov 1999 11:39:55 GMT   (16kb)';'   The renormalization group approach towards the string representation of non abelian gauge theories translates, in terms of the string sigma model beta function equations, the renormalization group evolution of the gauge coupling constant and Zamolodchikov`s $c$ function. Tachyon stability, glueball mass gap, renormalization group evolution of the $c$ function and the area law for the Wilson loop are studied for a critical bosonic string vacuum corresponding to a non abelian gauge theory in four dimensional space-time. We prove that the same intrinsic geometry for the string vacuum is universal in some sense, reproducing the Yang-Mills beta function to arbitrary loop order in perturbation theory. '
9911216;'Critical amplitudes and mass spectrum of the 2D Ising model in a';'M.Caselle and M.Hasenbusch';'Fri, 26 Nov 1999 14:38:37 GMT   (34kb)';'   We compute the spectrum and several critical amplitudes of the two dimensional Ising model in a magnetic field with the transfer matrix method. The three lightest masses and their overlaps with the spin and the energy operators are computed on lattices of a width up to L=21. In extracting the continuum results we also take into account the corrections to scaling due to irrelevant operators. In contrast with previous Monte Carlo simulations our final results are in perfect agreement with the predictions of S-matrix and conformal field theory. We also obtain the amplitudes of some of the subleading corrections, for which no S-matrix prediction has yet been obtained. '
9911217;'Kasner Asymptotics of Horava-Witten Cosmology';'Mariusz P. Dabrowski';'Fri, 26 Nov 1999 15:25:35 GMT   (40kb)';'   Bianchi type I and type IX ('Mixmaster') geometries are investigated within the framework of Ho\v{r}ava-Witten cosmology. We consider the models for which the fifth coordinate is a $S^1/Z_2$ orbifold while the four coordinates are such that the 3-space is homogeneous and has geometry of Bianchi type I or IX while the rest six dimensions have already been compactified on a Calabi-Yau space. In particular, we study Kasner-type solutions of the Bianchi I field equations and discuss Kasner asymptotics of Bianchi IX field equations. We are able to recover the isotropic 3-space solutions found by Lukas {\it et al}. Finally, we discuss if such Bianchi IX configuration can result in chaotic behaviour of these Ho\v{r}ava-Witten cosmologies. '
9911218;'Solitons in Brane Worlds';'Donam Youm';'Fri, 26 Nov 1999 16:44:53 GMT   (11kb)';'   We study some aspects of dilatonic domain walls in relation to the idea on the noncompact internal space. We find that the warp factor in the spacetime metric increases as one moves away from the domain wall for all the supersymmetric dilatonic domain wall solutions obtained from the (intersecting) BPS branes in string theories through toroidal compactifications, unlike the case of the Randall-Sundrum model. On the other hand, when the dilaton coupling parameter a for the D-dimensional extreme dilatonic domain wall takes the values |a|<2/(D-2), the Kaluza-Klein spectrum of graviton has the same structure as that of the Randall-Sundrum model (and the warp factor decreases in the finite interval around the dilatonic domain wall), thereby implying the possibility of extending the Randall-Sundrum model to the |a|<2/(D-2) case. We construct fully localized solutions describing extreme dilatonic branes within extreme dilatonic domain walls and the supersymmetric branes within the supersymmetric domain walls of string theories. These solutions are valid in any region of spacetime, not just in the region close to the domain walls. '
9911219;'On Equivalence of Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau and Klein-Gordon Equations';'V. Ya. Fainberg and B. M. Pimentel (Sao Paulo, IFT)';'Fri, 26 Nov 1999 17:11:54 GMT   (16kb)';'   A strict proof of equivalence between Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) and Klein-Gordon (KG) theories is presented for physical S-matrix elements in the case of charged scalar particles interacting in minimal way with an external or quantized electromagnetic field. First, Hamiltonian canonical approach to DKP theory is developed in both component and matrix form. The theory is then quantized through the construction of the generating functional for Green functions (GF) and the physical matrix elements of S-matrix are proved to be relativistic invariants. The equivalence between both theories is then proved using the connection between GF and the elements of S-matrix, including the case of only many photons states, and for more general conditions - so called reduction formulas of Lehmann, Symanzik, Zimmermann.

9911220;'Generalization of Calabi-Yau/Landau-Ginzburg correspondence';'Tohru Eguchi (Univ. of Tokyo, Phys. Dept.), Masao Jinzenji (Univ. of';'Sat, 27 Nov 1999 08:32:37 GMT   (15kb)';'   We discuss a possible generalization of the Calabi-Yau/Landau-Ginzburg correspondence to a more general class of manifolds. Specifically we consider the Fermat type hypersurfaces $M_N^k$: $\sum_{i=1}^N X_i^k =0$ in ${\bf CP}^{N-1}$ for various values of k and N. When k<N, the 1-loop beta function of the sigma model on $M_N^k$ is negative and we expect the theory to have a mass gap. However, the quantum cohomology relation $\sigma^{N-1}={const.}\sigma^{k-1}$ suggests that in addition to the massive vacua there exists a remaining massless sector in the theory if k>2. We assume that this massless sector is described by a Landau-Ginzburg (LG) theory of central charge $c=3N(1-2/k)$ with N chiral fields with U(1) charge $1/k$. We compute the topological invariants (elliptic genera) using LG theory and massive vacua and compare them with the geometrical data. We find that the results agree if and only if k=even and N=even.   These are the cases when the hypersurfaces have a spin structure. Thus we find an evidence for the geometry/LG correspondence in the case of spin manifolds. '
9911221;'On Low-Energy Effective Actions in N = 2, 4 Superconformal Theories in';'I.L. Buchbinder, S.M. Kuzenko, A.A. Tseytlin';'Sat, 27 Nov 1999 18:21:54 GMT   (16kb)';'   We study some aspects of low-energy effective actions in 4-d superconformal gauge theories on the Coulomb branch. We describe superconformal invariants constructed in terms of N=2 abelian vector multiplet which play the role of building blocks for the N=2,4 supersymmetric low-energy effective actions. We compute the one-loop effective actions in constant N=2 field strength background in N=4 SYM theory and in N=2 SU(2) SYM theory with four hypermultiplets in fundamental representation. Using the classification of superconformal invariants we then find the manifestly N=2 superconformal form of these effective actions. While our explicit computations are done in the one-loop approximation, our conclusions about the structure of the effective actions in N=2 superconformal theories are general. We comment on some applications to supergravity - gauge theory duality in the description of D-brane interactions. '
9911222;'The Operator Product Expansion of N=4 SYM and the 4-point Functions of';'Eric D'Hoker, Samir D. Mathur, Alec Matusis, Leonardo Rastelli';'Sun, 28 Nov 1999 02:54:35 GMT   (63kb)';'   We give a detailed Operator Product Expansion interpretation of the results for conformal 4-point functions computed from supergravity through the AdS/CFT duality. We show that for an arbitrary scalar exchange in AdS(d+1) all the power-singular terms in the direct channel limit (and only these terms) exactly match the corresponding contributions to the OPE of the operator dual to the exchanged bulk field and of its conformal descendents. The leading logarithmic singularities in the 4-point functions of protected N=4 super-Yang Mills operators (computed from IIB supergravity on AdS(5) X S(5) are interpreted as O(1/N^2) renormalization effects of the double-trace products appearing in the OPE. Applied to the 4-point functions of the operators Ophi ~ tr F^2 + ... and Oc ~ tr FF~ + ..., this analysis leads to the prediction that the double-trace composites [Ophi Oc] and [Ophi Ophi - Oc Oc] have anomalous dimension -16/N^2 in the large N, large g_{YM}^2 N limit. We describe a geometric picture of the OPE in the dual gravitational theory, for both the power-singular terms and the leading logarithms. We comment on several possible extensions of our results. '

It is shown that the formula involves no finite-volume correction. Each term of the reaction-rate formula represents a set of physical processes that contribute to the reaction under consideration.

Using this result, lagrangians for auxiliary fields are generalized to non-quadratic forms. In supersymmetric effective nonlinear lagrangians, the arbitrariness due to the existence of quasi Nambu-Goldstone bosons is shown to disappear when local auxiliary gauge fields are introduced. '
9911227;'Ultraviolet and Infrared Finiteness in Two Dimensional Curved Space-Time';'H. Zerrouki';'Mon, 29 Nov 1999 11:09:34 GMT   (15kb)';'   Different models of field theories in two dimensions can be described by the action $Tr\int \vf F$. In the presence of a curved background, we construct a local supersymmetry-like transformations under which the action is invariant. Furthermore, by analysing the cohomology of the theory we show the absence of anomalies. Also the ultraviolet as well as the infrared finiteness of the theory are proven to all orders of perturbation theory. '
9911228;'4-dimensional BF Gravity on the Lattice';'Noboru Kawamoto, Noriaki Sato, Yukiya Uchida';'Mon, 29 Nov 1999 13:10:22 GMT   (149kb)';'   We propose the lattice version of $BF$ gravity action whose partition function leads to the product of a particular form of 15-$j$ symbol which corresponds to a 4-simplex. The action is explicitly constructed by lattice $B$ field defined on triangles and link variables defined on dual links and is shown to be invariant under lattice local Lorentz transformation and Kalb-Ramond gauge transformation. We explicitly show that the partition function is Pachner move invariant and thus topological. The action includes the vanishing holonomy constraint which can be interpreted as a gauge fixing condition. This formulation of lattice $BF$ theory can be generalized into arbitrary dimensions. '

Sousa';'Mon, 29 Nov 1999 13:29:45 GMT   (18kb)';'   The open descendants of simple current automorphism invariants are constructed. We consider the case where the order of the current is two or odd. We prove that our solutions satisfy the completeness conditions, positivity and integrality of the open and closed sectors and the Klein bottle constraint (apart from an interesting exception). In order to do this, we derive some new relations between the tensor Y and the fixed point conformal field theory. Some non-standard Klein bottle projections are considered as well. '
9911230;'Asymptotically Anti-de Sitter Space-times: Conserved Quantities';'Abhay Ashtekar and Saurya Das (CGPG, Penn State University)';'Mon, 29 Nov 1999 15:45:22 GMT   (19kb)';'   Asymptotically anti-de Sitter space-times are considered in a general dimension $d\ge 4$. As one might expect, the boundary conditions at infinity ensure that the asymptotic symmetry group is the anti-de Sitter group (although there is an interesting subtlety if d=4). Asymptotic field equations imply that, associated with each generator $\xi$ of this group, there is a quantity $Q_\xi$ which satisfies the expected `balance equation' if there is flux of physical matter fields across the boundary $\I$ at infinity and is absolutely conserved in absence of this flux. Irrespective of the dimension d, all these quantities vanish if the space-time under considerations is (globally) anti-de Sitter. Furthermore, this result is required by a general covariance argument. However, it contradicts some of the recent findings based on the conjectured ADS/CFT duality. This and other features of our analysis suggest that, if a consistent dictionary between gravity and conformal field theories does exist in fully non-perturbative regimes, it would have to be more subtle than the one used currently.

9911231;'Aharonov-Bohm Effect in the Abelian-Projected SU(3)-QCD with';'Dmitri Antonov (INFN, Pisa)';'Mon, 29 Nov 1999 15:47:15 GMT   (13kb)';'   By making use of the path-integral duality transformation, string representation of the Abelian-projected SU(3)-QCD with the $\Theta$-term is derived. Besides the short-range (self-)interactions of quarks (which due to the $\Theta$-term acquire a nonvanishing magnetic charge, i.e. become dyons) and electric Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen strings, the resulting effective action contains also a long-range topological interaction of dyons with strings. This interaction, which has the form of the 4D Gauss linking number of the trajectory of a dyon with the world-sheet of a closed string, is shown to become nontrivial at $\Theta$ not equal to $3\pi$ times an integer. At these values of $\Theta$, closed electric Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen strings in the model under study can be viewed as solenoids scattering dyons, which is the 4D analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm effect.

9911232;'Nonstandard coproducts and the Izergin-Korepin open spin chain';'Rafael I. Nepomechie';'Mon, 29 Nov 1999 18:47:22 GMT   (6kb)';'   Corresponding to the Izergin-Korepin (A_2^(2)) R matrix, there are three diagonal solutions (``K matrices'') of the boundary Yang-Baxter equation. Using these R and K matrices, one can construct transfer matrices for open integrable quantum spin chains. The transfer matrix corresponding to the identity matrix K=1 is known to have U_q(o(3)) symmetry. We argue here that the transfer matrices corresponding to the other two K matrices also have U_q(o(3)) symmetry, but with a nonstandard coproduct. We briefly explore some of the consequences of this symmetry. '
9911233;'Discrete gauge fields';'Manoelito M de Souza';'Mon, 29 Nov 1999 20:00:54 GMT   (43kb)';'   The use of proper time as a tool for causality implementation in field theory is clarified and extended to allow a manifestly covariant definition of discrete fields proper to be applied in field theory and quantum mechanics. It implies on a constraint between a radiation field and its sources, valid in principle for all fundamental interactions and with a solid experimental confirmation for the electromagnetic one. Some results of its applications to an abelian classical theory (electrodynamics taken as a first example), and with the discrete field being regarded as a classical representation of the field quantum (photon) are anticipated in order to illuminate the physical meaning and the origins of gauge fields and of their symmetries and singularities. They are associated to a loss of field-source coherence. '
9911234;'Non-Compact $AdS_5$ Universe with Parallel Positive Tension 3-Branes';'Tianjun Li';'Mon, 29 Nov 1999 21:31:47 GMT   (8kb)';'   We construct the general model with only parallel positive tension 3-branes on $M^4 \times R^1$ and $M^4 \times R^1/Z_2$. The cosmology constant is sectional constant along the fifth dimension. In this general scenario, the 5-dimensional GUT scale on each brane can be indentified as the 5-dimensional Planck scale, but, the 4-dimensional Planck scale is generated from the low 4-dimensional GUT scale exponentially in our world. We also give two simple models to show explicitly how to solve the gauge hierarchy problem. '
9911235;'Fluid Dynamical Profiles and Constants of Motion from D-Branes';'R. Jackiw';'Mon, 29 Nov 1999 21:32:34 GMT   (135kb)';'   Various fluid mechanical systems, governed by nonlinear differential equations, enjoy a hidden, higher-dimensional dynamical Poincar\'e symmetry, which arises owing to their descent from a Nambu-Goto action. Also, for the same reason, there are equivalence transformations between different models. These interconnections are discussed in this lecture, and are summarized in Fig. 3. '
9911237;'Mass Gap in Kaluza-Klein Spectrum in a Network of Brane Worlds';'Soonkeon Nam (Harvard and Kyung Hee Univ.)';'Mon, 29 Nov 1999 22:04:07 GMT   (9kb)';'   We consider the Newton's force law for brane world consisting of periodic configuration of branes. We show that it supports a massless graviton. Furthermore, this massless mode is well separated from the Kaluza-Klein spectrum by a mass gap. Thus most of the problems in phenomenology coming from continuum of Kaluza-Klein modes without mass gap are potentially cured in such a model. '
9911238;'Consistency of the $AdS_7\times S_4$ reduction and the origin of';'Horatiu Nastase, Diana Vaman and Peter van Niewenhuizen (YITP Stony';'Mon, 29 Nov 1999 23:32:37 GMT   (59kb)';'   We discuss the full nonlinear Kaluza-Klein (KK) reduction of the original formulation of d=11 supergravity on $AdS_7\times S_4$ to gauged maximal ({\cal N}=4) supergravity in 7 dimensions. We derive the full nonlinear embedding of the d=7 fields in the d=11 fields (``the ansatz'') and check the consistency of the ansatz by deriving the d=7 supersymmetry laws from the d=11 transformation laws in the various sectors. The ansatz itself is nonpolynomial but the final d=7 results are polynomial. The correct d=7 scalar potential is obtained. For most of our results the explicit form of the matrix U connecting the d=7 gravitino to the Killing spinor is not needed, but we derive the equation which U has to satisfy and present a solution. Requiring that the expression $\delta F=d\delta A$ in d=11 can be written as $\delta d(fields in d=7)$, we find the ansatz for the 4-form F. It satisfies the Bianchi identities. The corresponding ansatz for A modifies the geometrical proposal by Freed et al. by including d=7 scalar fields. A first order formulation for the three index photon $A_{\Lambda\Pi\Sigma}$ in d=11 is needed to obtain the d=7 supersymmetry laws and the action for the nonabelian selfdual antisymmetric tensor field $S_{\alpha\beta\gamma,A}$. Therefore selfduality in odd dimensions originates from a first order formalism in higher dimensions. '
9911239;'The formulae of Kontsevich and Verlinde from the perspective of the';'C. Klimcik';'Mon, 29 Nov 1999 23:10:16 GMT   (25kb)';'   A two dimensional gauge theory is canonically associated to every Drinfeld double. For particular doubles, the theory turns out to be e.g. the ordinary Yang-Mills theory, the G/G gauged WZNW model or the Poisson $\sigma$-model that underlies the Kontsevich quantization formula. We calculate the arbitrary genus partition function of the latter. The result is the $q$-deformation of the ordinary Yang-Mills partition function in the sense that the series over the weights is replaced by the same series over the $q$-weights. For $q$ equal to a root of unity the series acquires the affine Weyl symmetry and its truncation to the alcove coincides with the Verlinde formula. '
9911240;'Renormalization Group Flows from Five-Dimensional Supergravity';'N.P. Warner';'Mon, 29 Nov 1999 23:55:06 GMT   (104kb)';'   The use of gauged ${\cal N} = 8$ supergravity as a tool in studying the AdS/CFT correspondence for ${\cal N} = 4$ Yang-Mills theory is reviewed. The supergravity potential implies a non-trivial, supersymmetric IR fixed point, and the flow to this fixed point is described in terms of a supergravity kink. The results agree perfectly with earlier, independent field theory results. A supergravity inspired $c$-function, and corresponding $c$-theorem is discussed for general flows, and the simplified form for supersymmetric flows is also given. Flows along the Coulomb branch of the Yang-Mills theory are also described from the five-dimensional perspective. '
9911241;'Singletons and Neutrinos';'Christian Fronsdal (UCLA)';'Tue, 30 Nov 1999 00:00:41 GMT   (10kb)';'   The first half is a rapid review of 30 years of work on physics in anti-De Sitter space, with heavy emphasis on singletons. Principal topics are the kinematical basis for regarding singletons as the constituents of massless particles, and the effect of (negative) curvature in the infrared domain. Ideas that lead to an alternative to Big Bang cosmology are merely sketched. The second half presents new ideas inspired by experimental results on neutrino oscillations. Since leptons are massless before symmetry breaking it is natural to view them as composite states consisting of one Bose singleton (the Rac) and one Fermi singleton (the Di). This gives rise to a particular formulation of the phenomenology of electroweak physics, and strong suggestions for an expansion of the Standard model. An expansion of the Higgs sector seems inevitable, and flavor changing symmetry, complete with a new set of heavy vector mesons, is a very attractive possibility. '
9911242;'Non-Abelian Stokes Theorem and Quark Confinement in SU(N) Yang-Mills';'Kei-Ichi Kondo and Yutaro Taira (Chiba University)';'Tue, 30 Nov 1999 02:48:57 GMT   (260kb)';'   We derive a new version of the non-Abelian Stokes theorem for the Wilson loop in the SU(N) case by making use of the coherent state representation on the coset space $SU(N)/U(1)^{N-1}=F_{N-1}$, the flag space. We consider the SU(N) Yang-Mills theory in the maximal Abelian gauge in which SU(N) is broken down to $U(1)^{N-1}$. First, we show that the Abelian dominance in the string tension follows from this theorem and the Abelian-projected effective gauge theory that was derived by one of the authors. Next (but independently), combining the non-Abelian Stokes theorem with a novel reformulation of the Yang-Mills theory recently proposed by one of the authors, we proceed to derive the area law of the Wilson loop in four-dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills theory in the maximal Abelian gauge. Owing to dimensional reduction, the planar Wilson loop at least for the fundamental representation in four-dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills theory can be estimated by the diagonal (Abelian) Wilson loop defined in the two-dimensional $CP^{N-1}$ model. This derivation shows that the fundamental quarks are confined by a single species of magnetic monopole. The origin of the area law is related to the geometric phase of the Wilczek-Zee holonomy for $U(N-1)$. The calculations are performed using the instanton calculus (in the dilute instanton-gas approximation) and using the large $N$ expansion (in the leading order). '
9911243;'The Mass Spectrum of N=1 SYM(2+1) at Strong Coupling';'Paul Haney, John R. Hiller, Oleg Lunin, Stephen Pinsky, Uwe Trittmann';'Tue, 30 Nov 1999 04:19:27 GMT   (72kb)';'   We consider supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on R x S^1 x S^1. In particular, we choose one of the compact directions to be light-like and another to be space-like. Since the SDLCQ regularization explicitly preserves supersymmetry, this theory is totally finite, and thus we can solve for bound state wave functions and masses numerically without renormalizing. We present the masses as functions of the longitudinal and transverse resolutions and show that the masses converge rapidly in both resolutions. We also study the behavior of the spectrum as a function of the coupling and find that at strong coupling there is a stable, well defined spectrum which we present. We also find several unphysical states that decouple at large transverse resolution. There are two sets of massless states; one set is massless only at zero coupling and the other is massless at all couplings. Together these sets of massless states are in one-to-one correspondence with the full spectrum of the dimensionally reduced theory. '
9911244;'On the equivalence between topologically and non-topologically massive';'E. Harikumar and M. Sivakumar';'Tue, 30 Nov 1999 04:41:07 GMT   (9kb)';'   We analyse the equivalence between topologically massive gauge theory (TMGT) and different formulations of non-topologically massive gauge theories (NTMGTs) in the canonical approach. The different NTMGTs studied are St\"uckelberg formulation of (A) a first order formulation involving one and two form fields, (B) Proca theory, and (C) massive Kalb-Ramond theory. We first quantise these reducible gauge systems by using the phase space extension procedure and using it, identify the phase space variables of NTMGTs which are equivalent to the canonical variables of TMGT and show that under this the Hamiltonian also get mapped. Interestingly it is found that the different NTMGTs are equivalent to different formulations of TMGTs which differ only by a total divergence term. We also provide covariant mappings between the fields in TMGT to NTMGTs at the level of correlation function. '
9911245;'Instantons in the U(1) Born-Infeld Theory and Noncommutative Gauge';'Seiji Terashima';'Tue, 30 Nov 1999 05:30:27 GMT   (8kb)';'   We derive a BPS-type bound for four-dimensional Born-Infeld action with constant B field background. The supersymmetric configuration saturates this bound and is regarded as an analog of instanton in U(1) gauge theory. Furthermore, we find the explicit solutions of this BPS condition. These solutions have a finite action proportional to the instanton number and represent D(p-4)-branes within a Dp-brane although they have a singularity at the origin. Some relations to the noncommutative U(1) instanton are discussed. '
9911246;'Magnetic Interactions of D-branes and Wess-Zumino Terms in Super';'A. A. Tseytlin, K. Zarembo';'Tue, 30 Nov 1999 05:06:21 GMT   (15kb)';'   There is a close relation between classical supergravity and quantum SYM descriptions of interactions between separated branes. In the case of D3 branes, the equivalence of leading-order potentials is due to non-renormalization of the F^4 term in N=4 SYM theory. Here we point out the existence of another special non-renormalized term in quantum SYM effective action. This term reproduces the interaction potential between electric charge of a D3-brane probe and magnetic charge of a D3-brane source, represented by the Chern-Simons part of the D-brane action. This unique Wess-Zumino term depends on all six scalar fields and originates from a phase of the euclidean fermion determinant in SYM theory. It is manifestly scale invariant (i.e. is the same for large and small separations between branes) and can not receive higher loop corrections in gauge theory. Maximally supersymmetric SYM theories in D=p+1>4 contain mixed WZ terms which depend on both scalar and gauge field backgrounds, and which reproduce the corresponding CS terms in the supergravity interaction potentials between separated Dp-branes for p>3. Purely scalar WZ terms appear in other cases, e.g., in N=2 gauge theories in various dimensions describing magnetic interactions between Dp and D(6-p) branes. '

Nesterenko';'Tue, 30 Nov 1999 10:19:19 GMT   (11kb)';'   The Casimir energy of a non-uniform string built up from two pieces with different speed of sound is calculated. A standard procedure of subtracting the energy of an infinite uniform string is applied, the subtraction being interpreted as the renormalization of the string tension. It is shown that in the case of a homogeneous string this method is completely equivalent to the zeta renormalization. '
9911249;'Matrix strings from generalized Yang-Mills theory on arbitrary Riemann';'M. Billo', A D'Adda and P. Provero';'Tue, 30 Nov 1999 14:48:27 GMT   (30kb)';'   We quantize pure 2d Yang-Mills theory on an arbitrary Riemann surface in the gauge where the field strength is diagonal. Twisted sectors originate, as in Matrix string theory, from permutations of the eigenvalues around homotopically non-trivial loops. These sectors, that must be discarded in the usual quantization due to divergences occurring when two eigenvalues coincide, can be consistently kept if one modifies the action by introducing a coupling of the field strength to the space-time curvature. This leads to a generalized Yang-Mills theory whose action reduces to the usual one in the limit of zero curvature. After integrating over the non-diagonal components of the gauge fields, the theory becomes a free string theory (sum over unbranched coverings) with a U(1) gauge theory on the world-sheet. This is shown to be equivalent to a lattice theory with a gauge group which is the semi-direct product of S_N and U(1)^N. By using well known results on the statistics of coverings, the partition function on arbitrary Riemann surfaces and the kernel functions on surfaces with boundaries are calculated. Extensions to include branch points and non-abelian groups on the world-sheet are briefly commented upon. '
9911251;'Non-commutativity, Zero modes and D-brane Geometry';'Supriya Kar';'Tue, 30 Nov 1999 18:54:53 GMT   (13kb)';'   The non-commutative geometry is revisited from the perspective of a generalized D p-brane. In particular, we analyze the open bosonic string world-sheet description and show that an effective non-commutative description on a D p-brane corresponds to a re-normalized world-volume. The world-volume correlators are analyzed to make a note on the non-commutative geometry. It is argued that the U(1) gauge symmetry can be viewed in a homomorphic image space for the non-commutative space of coordinates with an SO(p) symmetry. In the large B-field limit, the non-commutativity reduces to that among the zero modes and the world-volume description is precisely in agreement with the holographic principle. '

In particular this reveals a new relationship between the gauge group E_8 and 11-dimensional space. '
9911253;'Curved branes from string dualities';'G. Papadopoulos, J. Russo and A.A. Tseytlin';'Tue, 30 Nov 1999 20:01:22 GMT   (21kb)';'   We describe a simple method for generating new string solutions for which the brane worldvolume is a curved space. As a starting point we use solutions with NS-NS charges combined with 2-d CFT's representing different parts of space-time. We illustrate our method with many examples, some of which are associated with conformally invariant sigma models. Using U-duality, we also obtain supergravity solutions with RR charges which can be interpreted as D-branes with non-trivial worldvolume geometry. In particular, we discuss the case of a D5-brane wrapped on AdS_3 x S^3, a solution interpolating between AdS_3 x S^3 x R^5 and AdS_3 x S^3 x S^3 x R, and a D3-brane wrapped over S^3 x R or AdS_2 x S^2. Another class of solutions we discuss involves NS5-branes intersecting over a 3-space and NS5-branes intersecting over a line. These solutions are similar to D7-brane or cosmic string backgrounds. '
9911254;'Remarks on Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau theory and gauge invariance';'J. T. Lunardi, B. M. Pimentel, R. G. Teixeira and J. S. Valverde (Sao';'Tue, 30 Nov 1999 22:50:24 GMT   (11kb)';'   Two problems relative to the electromagnetic coupling of Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) theory are discussed: the presence of an anomalous term in the Hamiltonian form of the theory and the apparent difference between the Interaction terms in DKP and Klein-Gordon (KG) Lagrangians. For this, we first discuss the behavior of DKP field and its physical components under gauge transformations. From this analysis, we can show that these problems simply do not exist if one correctly analyses the physical components of DKP field. '
9911255;'Comparing Instanton Contributions with Exact Results in N=2';'Philip C. Argyres and Sophie Pelland';'Tue, 30 Nov 1999 23:59:28 GMT   (21kb)';'   We discuss the general issues and ambiguities involved in matching the exact results for the low energy effective action of scale invariant N=2 supersymmetric QCD to those obtained by instanton methods. We resolve the reported disagreements and verify agreement between an infinite series of coefficients in the low energy effective actions calculated in the two approaches. In particular, we show that the exact low-energy effective couplings for SU(N) for all N with 2N fundamental hypermultiplets agree at a special vacuum on the Coulomb branch where a large unbroken discrete global symmetry makes the matching of parameters relatively straightforward.

The irreducible setting is enforced by means of constructing an irreducible Hamiltonian first-class model that is equivalent from the BRST point of view to the original redundant theory. The irreducible path integral can be brought to a manifestly Lorentz covariant form. '
9912202;'W-algebras from symplectomorphisms';'G. Bandelloni (INFN-Genoa), S. Lazzarini (CPT-Marseille)';'Tue, 21 Dec 1999 14:36:44 GMT   (19kb)';'   It is shown how $W$-algebras emerge from very peculiar canonical transformations with respect to the canonical symplectic structure on a compact Riemann surface. The action of smooth diffeomorphisms of the cotangent bundle on suitable generating functions is written in the BRS framework while a $W$-symmetry is exhibited. Subsequently, the complex structure of the symmetry spaces is studied and the related BRS properties are discussed. The specific example of the so-called $W_3$-algebra is treated in relation to some other different approaches. '

We investigate in detail the orientifolds of the Z_3, Z_4, Z_6 and Z_6' toroidal orbifolds finding solutions to the tadpole cancellation conditions for all models. Generically, all the massless spectra turn out to be non-chiral. '

The approach is pragmatic, rather than traditional or artistic: It includes practical techniques, such as the 1/N expansion (color ordering) and spacecone (spinor helicity), and diverse topics, such as supersymmetry and general relativity, as well as introductions to supergravity and strings. The PDF version can be more convenient than paper books, with Web links and a clickable outline (contents) window. '
9912206;'Target-Space Duality in Heterotic and Type I Effective Lagrangians';'Zygmunt Lalak, St\'ephane Lavignac, Hans Peter Nilles';'Tue, 21 Dec 1999 16:26:18 GMT   (34kb)';'   We study the implications of target-space duality symmetries for low-energy effective actions of various four-dimensional string theories. In the heterotic case such symmetries can be incorporated in simple orbifold examples. At present a similar statement cannot be made about the simplest type IIB orientifolds due to an obstruction at the level of gravitational anomalies. This fact confirms previous doubts concerning a conjectured heterotic-type IIB orientifold duality and shows that target-space symmetries can be a powerful tool in studying relations between various string theories at the level of the effective low-energy action. Contraints on effective Lagrangians from these symmetries are discussed in detail. In particular, we consider ways of extending T-duality to include additional corrections to the Kaehler potential in heterotic string models with N=2 subsectors. '
9912207;'Three-dimensional QCD in the adjoint representation and random matrix';'U. Magnea';'Tue, 21 Dec 1999 17:13:21 GMT   (14kb)';'   In this paper we complete the derivations of finite volume partition functions for QCD using random matrix theories by calculating the effective low-energy partition function for three-dimensional QCD in the adjoint representation from a random matrix theory with the same global symmetries. As expected, this case corresponds to Dyson index $\beta =4$, that is, the Dirac operator can be written in terms of real quaternions. After discussing the issue of defining Majorana fermions in Euclidean space, the actual matrix model calculation turns out to be simple. We find that the symmetry breaking pattern is $O(2N_f) \to O(N_f) \times O(N_f)$, as expected from the correspondence between symmetric (super)spaces and random matrix universality classes found by Zirnbauer. We also derive the first Leutwyler--Smilga sum rule. '
9912208;'Standard Models from Heterotic M-theory';'Ron Donagi (UPenn), Burt A. Ovrut (UPenn), Tony Pantev (UPenn), Daniel';'Tue, 21 Dec 1999 18:25:05 GMT   (58kb)';'   We present a class of N=1 supersymmetric models of particle physics, derived directly from heterotic M-theory, that contain three families of chiral quarks and leptons coupled to the gauge group $SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_{L}\times U(1)_{Y}$. These models are a fundamental form of ``brane-world'' theories, with an observable and hidden sector each confined, after compactification on a Calabi-Yau threefold, to a BPS threebrane separated by a five-dimensional bulk space with size of the order of the intermediate scale. The requirement of three families, coupled to the fundamental conditions of anomaly freedom and supersymmetry, constrains these models to contain additional fivebranes wrapped around holomorphic curves in the Calabi-Yau threefold. These fivebranes ``live'' in the bulk space and represent new, non-perturbative aspects of these particle physics vacua. We discuss, in detail, the relevant mathematical structure of a class of torus-fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds with non-trivial first homotopy groups and construct holomorphic vector bundles over such threefolds, which, by including Wilson lines, break the gauge symmetry to the standard model gauge group. Rules for constructing phenomenological particle physics models in this context are presented and we give a number of explicit examples. '
9912209;'Black Hole Formation in AdS and Thermalization on the Boundary';'Ulf H. Danielsson, Esko Keski-Vakkuri, Martin Kruczenski';'Tue, 21 Dec 1999 18:25:38 GMT   (28kb)';'   We investigate black hole formation by a spherically collapsing thin shell of matter in AdS space. This process has been suggested to have a holographic interpretation as thermalization of the CFT on the boundary of the AdS space. The AdS/CFT duality relates the shell in the bulk to an off-equilibrium state of the boundary theory which evolves towards a thermal equilibrium when the shell collapses to a black hole. We use 2-point functions to obtain information about the spectrum of excitations in the off-equilibrium state, and discuss how it characterizes the approach towards thermal equilibrium. The full holographic interpretation of the gravitational collapse would require a kinetic theory of the CFT at strong coupling. We speculate that the kinetic equations should be interpreted as a holographic dual of the equation of motion of the collapsing shell. '
9912210;'Scalar Quartic Couplings in Type IIB Supergravity on $AdS_5\times S^5$';'G.Arutyunov and S.Frolov';'Tue, 21 Dec 1999 22:16:52 GMT   (43kb)';'   All quartic couplings of scalar fields $s^I$ that are dual to extended chiral primary operators in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM$_4$ are derived by using the covariant equations of motion for type IIB supergravity on $AdS_5\times S^5$. It is shown that despite some expectations if one keeps the structure of the cubic terms untouched, the quartic action obtained contains terms with two and four derivatives. It is shown that the quartic action vanishes on shell in the extremal case, e.g. k_1=k_2+k_3+k_4. Consistency of the truncation of the quartic couplings to the massless multiplet of the ${\cal N}=8$, d=5 supergravity is proven and the explicit values of the couplings are found. It is argued that the consistency of the KK reduction implies non-renormalization of $n$-point functions of $n-1$ operators dual to the fields from the massless multiplet and one operator dual to a field from a massive multiplet.

9912211;'Non-BPS domain wall configurations in a supersymmetric model';'V. A. Gani, A. E. Kudryavtsev';'Wed, 22 Dec 1999 00:29:32 GMT   (49kb)';'   We study the time evolution of configurations in the form of two parallel domain walls moving towards each other in a supersymmetric field model. The configurations involved are not BPS-saturated. It is found that for such collisions there exists some critical value $v_{cr}\approx0.9120$ of the initial velocity v_i of the walls. At v_i<v_{cr} we observed reflection, that was not followed by change of vacuum states sequence. In collisions with v_i>v_{cr} the sequence of vacuum states changes. The results of the numerical simulations are in agreement with "potential" consideration. '
9912212;'Noncommutative supergeometry and duality';'Albert Schwarz';'Wed, 22 Dec 1999 06:07:46 GMT   (12kb)';'   We introduce a notion of Q-algebra that can be considered as a generalization of the notion of Q-manifold (a supermanifold equipped with an odd vector field obeying {Q,Q} =0). We develop the theory of connections on modules over Q-algebras and prove a general duality theorem for gauge theories on such modules. This theorem contains as a simplest case SO(d,d,{\bf Z})-duality of gauge theories on noncommutative tori. '
9912213;'Rotation of D-brane and Non-commutative Geometry';'Pei Wang and Ruihong Yue';'Wed, 22 Dec 1999 08:20:03 GMT   (8kb)';'   Our motivation is to find the relationship between the commutator of coordinates and uncertainty relation involving only the coordinates. The boundary condition with constant background field is connected with the rotation of D-brane at general angle. And the mode expansions of D-brane we found is more reasonable than those appeared in literature. The partition functions and scattering amplitudes are also discussed. '
9912214;'Normal Bundles, Pfaffians and Anomalies';'L.Bonora and M.Rinaldi';'Wed, 22 Dec 1999 09:13:06 GMT   (18kb)';'   We deal with the problem of diffeomorphism anomaly in theories with branes. In particular we thoroughly analyze the problem of the residual chiral anomaly of a five-brane immersed in M-theory, paying attention to its global formulation in the five-brane world-volume. We conclude that the anomaly can be canceled by a {\it local} counterterm in the five-brane world-volume. '

In the large N_c limit, the solutions of NPRG with various cutoff schemes are shown. For a sufficiently large ultra-violet cutoff, NPRG results coincide with those of Schwinger-Dyson equation and have little cutoff scheme dependence. Next, to improve the approximation, we incorporate the mesonic fluctuations. We introduce the auxiliary fields for mesons, and then derive NPRG equation for finite N_c. The chiral phase structure on (T,\mu) plane beyond the leading of 1/N_c expansion is investigated in the sharp cutoff limit. N_c dependence of chiral phase diagram is obtained. '

As a consequence, the hamiltonian as well as usual lagrangian non-abelian bosonization rules have been obtained, for the chiral currents and for the chiral densities. The expression for the anomaly has been obtained as a function of the Schwinger term, using canonical methods. '

This metric generalizes the usual Riemannian one. We investigate some general properties of this metric in the finite commutative case which corresponds to a metric on a finite set, and also give some examples of computations in both commutative and noncommutative cases.

As recently argued, their consistency is linked to the presence of geometric discrete moduli. The different classes of open descendants, related to different resolutions of the fixed-point ambiguities, are distinguished by the number of geometric fixed points surviving the unoriented projection.

9912219;'Application of Tomita-Takesaki theory in algebraic euclidean field';'Dirk Schlingemann';'Wed, 22 Dec 1999 12:56:43 GMT   (13kb)';'   The construction of the known interacting quantum field theory models is mostly based on euclidean techniques. The expectation values of interesting quantities are usually given in terms of euclidean correlation functions from which one should be able to extract information about the behavior of the correlation functions of the Minkowskian counterpart.   We think that the C*-algebraic approach to euclidean field theory gives an appropriate setup in order to study structural aspects model independently. A previous paper deals with a construction scheme which relates to each euclidean field theory a Poincar\'e covariant quantum field theory model in the sense of R. Haag and D. Kastler.   Within the framework of R. Haag and D. Kastler, the physical concept of PCT symmetry and spin and statistics is related to the Tomita-Takesaki theory of von Neumann algebras and this important aspects has been studied by several authors.   We express the PCT symmetry in terms of euclidean reflexions and we explicitly identify the corresponding modular operator and the modular conjugation of the related Tomita-Takesaki theory. Locality, wedge duality, and a geometric action of the modular group of the von Neumann algebra of observables, localized within a wedge region in Minkowski space, are direct consequences. '

9912222;'1/4 Partial Breaking of Global Supersymmetry and New Superparticle';'F. Delduc (ENS Lyon), E. Ivanov (JINR, Dubna), S. Krivonos (JINR,';'Wed, 22 Dec 1999 14:48:39 GMT   (22kb)';'   We construct the worldline superfield massive superparticle actions which preserve 1/4 portion of the underlying higher-dimensional supersymmetry. The rest of supersymmetry is spontaneously broken and realized by nonlinear transformations. We consider the cases of N=4 to N=1 and N=8 to N=2 partial breaking. In the first case we present the corresponding Green-Schwarz type target superspace action with one $\kappa$-supersymmetry. It is related to the superfield action via a field redefinition. In the second case we find out two possible models, one of which is a direct generalization of the N=4 to N=1 case, while another is essentially different. For the first model we formulate Green-Schwarz type action with two kappa supersymmetries. We elaborate on the bosonic part of the superfield action for the second model and find that only in two special limits it takes the standard Nambu-Goto form. In the general case it is determined by a fourth-order algebraic equation. The characteristic common feature of these new superparticle models is that the algebras of their spontaneously broken supersymmetries are non-trivial truncations of the general extensions of N=1 and N=2 Poincare D=4 superalgebras by tensorial central charges.

9912224;'Strings and black holes';'Thibault Damour';'Wed, 22 Dec 1999 15:05:16 GMT   (19kb)';'   I review some recent work (done in collaboration with G. Veneziano) which clarifies the existence of a correspondence between self-gravitating fundamental string states and Schwarzschild black holes. The main result is a detailed calculation showing that self-gravity causes a typical string state of mass M to shrink, as the string coupling g^2 increases, down to a compact string state whose mass, size, entropy and luminosity match (for the critical value g_c^2 = (M sqrt{alpha'})^{-1}) those of a Schwarzschild black hole. This confirms the idea that the entropy of black holes can be accounted for by counting string states, and suggests that the level spacing of the quantum states of Schwarzschild black holes is exponentially small, and very much blurred by radiative effects.

9912225;'BPS Amplitudes, Helicity Supertraces and Membranes in M-Theory';'Bernard de Wit, Dieter Lust';'Wed, 22 Dec 1999 15:08:27 GMT   (15kb)';'   We study BPS dominated loop amplitudes in M-theory on T^2. For this purpose we generalize the concept of helicity supertraces to nine spacetime dimensions. These traces distinguish between various massive supermultiplets and appear as coefficients in their one-loop contributions to n-graviton scattering amplitudes. This can be used to show that only ultrashort BPS multiplets contribute to the R^4 term in the effective action, which was first computed by Green, Gutperle and Vanhove. There are two inequivalent ultrashort BPS multiplets which describe the Kaluza-Klein states and the wrapped membranes that cover the torus a number of times. From the perspective of the type-II strings they correspond to momentum and winding states and D0 or D1 branes. '

The associated charges induce `shift'-symmetries of the scalar, spinor and gauge-fields of the fivebrane, so allowing an interpretation of all these fields as Goldstone fields. We also find that the fivebrane possesses a new symmetry that is part of the GL(32) automorphism group of the eleven dimensional supersymmetry algebra. '

Asymptotically in time the latter have boundaries represented by compact real three-manifolds. Therefore they lend themselves to an interpretation in terms of 3-brane scattering. We suggest that these solutions may represent scattering of D3-branes of type IIB theory in 10D. In particular we show that the world-volume theory on complex two-dimensional manifolds is the correct one for D3-branes. '

Relativistic Gamow vectors are obtained from the resonance pole of the S-matrix and furnish an irreducible representation of the Poincare' semigroup. They have all the properties needed to represent relativistic quasistable particles and can be used to fix the definition of mass and width of relativistic resonances like the Z-boson. Most remarkably, they have only a semigroup time evolution into the forward light cone---expressing time asymmetry on the microphysical level. '
9912229;'A New Mechanism of Spontaneous SUSY Breaking';'M. Sakamoto, M. Tachibana, K. Takenaga';'Wed, 22 Dec 1999 17:43:24 GMT   (141kb)';'   We propose a new mechanism of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. The existence of extra dimensions with nontrivial topology plays an important role. We investigate new features resulted from the mechanism in two simple supersymmetric Z_2 and U(1) models. One of remarkable features is that there exists a phase in which the translational invariance for the compactified directions is broken spontaneously, accompanying the breakdown of the supersymmetry. The mass spectrum of the models appeared in reduced dimensions is a full of variety, reflecting the highly nontrivial vacuum structure of the models. The Nambu-Goldstone bosons (fermions) associated with breakdown of symmetries are found in the mass spectrum. Our mechanism also yields quite different vacuum structures if models have different global symmetries. '
9912230;'A mass hierarchy from recoiling D branes';'G.K. Leontaris (CERN and Ioannina Un.), N.E. Mavromatos (Kings's';'Wed, 22 Dec 1999 22:38:25 GMT   (43kb)';'   Using conformal field theory methods we construct a metric that describes the distortion of space-time surrounding a D(irichlet)-brane (solitonic) defect after being struck by another D-brane. By viewing our four-dimensional universe as such a struck brane, embedded in a five-dimensional space-time, we argue on the appearance of a band of massive Kaluza-Klein excitations for the bulk graviton which is localized in a region of the fifth dimension determined by the inverse size of the band. The band incorporates the massless mode (ordinary graviton) and its thickness is determined essentially by the width of the Gaussian distribution describing the (target-space) quantum fluctuations of the intersecting-brane configuration.

9912232;'Localization of Matter and Cosmological Constant on a Brane in Anti de';'Borut Bajc, Gregory Gabadadze';'Thu, 23 Dec 1999 04:24:54 GMT   (13kb)';'   We study two issues, the localization of various spin fields, and the problem of the cosmological constant on a brane in five-dimensional anti de Sitter space. We find that spin-zero fields are localized on a positive-tension brane. In addition to the localized zero-mode there is a continuous tower of states with no mass gap. Spin one-half and three-half states can be localized on a brane with ``negative tension''. Their localization can be achieved on the positive-tension brane as well, if additional interactions are introduced. The necessary ingredient of the scenario with localized gravity is the relation between the bulk cosmological constant and the brane tension. In the absence of supersymmetry this implies fine-tuning between the parameters of the theory. To deal with this issue we introduce a four-form gauge field. This gives an additional arbitrary contribution to the bulk cosmological constant. As a result, the model gives rise to a continuous family of brane Universe solutions for generic values of the bulk cosmological constant and the brane tension. Among these solutions there is one with a zero four-dimensional cosmological constant. '
9912233;'Gravity, Stability and Energy Conservation on the Randall-Sundrum';'Misao Sasaki (Osaka), Tetsuya Shiromizu (Cambridge), Kei-ichi Maeda';'Thu, 23 Dec 1999 09:44:31 GMT   (14kb)';'   We carefully investigate the gravitational perturbation of the Randall-Sundrum (RS) single brane-world solution [hep-th/9906064], based on a covariant curvature tensor formalism recently developed by us. Using this curvature formalism, it is known that the `electric' part of the 5-dimensional Weyl tensor, denoted by $E_{\mu\nu}$, gives the leading order correction to the conventional Einstein equations on the brane. We consider the general solution of the perturbation equations for the 5-dimensional Weyl tensor caused by the matter fluctuations on the brane. By analyzing its asymptotic behaviour in the direction of the 5th dimension, we find the curvature invariant diverges as we approach the Cauchy horizon. However, in the limit of asymptotic future in the vicinity of the Cauchy horizon, the curvature invariant falls off fast enough to render the divergence harmless to the brane-world. We also obtain the asymptotic behavior of $E_{\mu\nu}$ on the brane at spatial infinity, assuming the matter perturbation is localized. We find it falls off sufficiently fast and will not affect the conserved quantities at spatial infinity. This indicates strongly that the usual conservation law, such as the ADM energy conservation, holds on the brane as far as asymptotically flat spacetimes are concerned. '

Recently this system was embedded in a more general Abelian gauge theory using the BFFT Hamiltonian method.

9912235;'Euclidean field theory on a sphere';'Dirk Schlingemann';'Thu, 23 Dec 1999 13:29:08 GMT   (15kb)';'   This paper is concerned with a structural analysis of euclidean field theories on the euclidean sphere. In the first section we give proposal for axioms for a euclidean field theory on a sphere in terms of C*-algebras.   Then, in the second section, we investigate the short-distance behavior of euclidean field theory models on the sphere by making use of the concept of {\em scaling algebras}, which has first been introduced by D. Buchholz, and R. Verch and which has also be applied to euclidean field theories on flat euclidean space in a previous paper. We establish the expected statement that that scaling limit theories of euclidean field theories on a sphere are euclidean field theories on flat euclidean space.   Keeping in mind that the minkowskian analogue of the euclidean sphere is the de Sitter space, we develop a Osterwalder-Schrader type construction scheme which assigns to a given euclidean field theory on the sphere a quantum field theory on de Sitter space. We show that the constructed quantum field theoretical data fulfills the so called geodesic KMS condition in the sense of H. J. Borchers and D. Buchholz, i.e. for any geodesic observer the system looks like a system within a thermal equilibrium state. '
9912236;'SO(d,d) Transformations of Ramond-Ramond Fields and Space-time Spinors';'S. F. Hassan (Ecole Polytechnique)';'Thu, 23 Dec 1999 13:44:59 GMT   (20kb)';'   We explicitly construct the SO(d,d) transformations of Ramond-Ramond field strengths and potentials, along with those of the space-time supersymmetry parameters, the gravitinos and the dilatinos in type-II theories. The results include the case when the SO(d,d) transformation involves the time direction. The derivation is based on the compatibility of SO(d,d) transformations with space-time supersymmetry, which automatically guarantees compatibility with the equations of motion. It involves constructing the spinor representation of a twist that an SO(d,d) action induces between the local Lorentz frames associated with the left- and right-moving sectors of the worldsheet theory. The relation to the transformation of R-R potentials as SO(d,d) spinors is also clarified. '
9912237;'Chiral Hybrid Bag Model with the Boson Field inside the Bag';'I. Cherednikov, S. Fedorov, M. Khalili and K. Sveshnikov';'Thu, 23 Dec 1999 14:08:45 GMT   (158kb)';'   The three-phase version of the hybrid chiral bag model, containing the phase of asymptotic freedom, the hadronization phase as well as the intermediate phase of constituent quarks, is proposed. For this model the self-consistent solution, which takes into account the fermion vacuum polarization effects, is found in (1+1) D. Within this solution the total energy of the bag, including the one-loop contribution from the Dirac's sea, is studied as the function of the bag geometry under condition of nonvanishing boson condensate density in the interior region. The existence and uniqueness of the ground state bag configuration, which minimizes the total energy and contains all the three phases, are shown. '
9912238;'Geometrical Evaluation of Star Products';'Cosmas Zachos';'Thu, 23 Dec 1999 15:53:08 GMT   (7kb)';'   The geometric picture of the star-product based on its Fourier representation kernel is utilized in the evaluation of chains of star-products and the intuitive appreciation of their associativity and symmetries. Such constructions appear even simpler for a variant asymmetric product, and carry through for the standard star-product supersymmetrization. '

The construction applies to any modular category. It is proved that these correlation functions obey modular and factorization rules. Structure constants are calculated and expressed in terms of the data of the modular category. '
9912240;'Finite Temperature QED: Non-Cancellation of Infrared Divergencies and';'Adrian Muller';'Thu, 23 Dec 1999 16:50:14 GMT   (79kb)';'   In this work quantum electrodynamics at T > 0 is considered. For this purpose we use thermo field dynamics and the causal approach to quantum field theory according to Epstein and Glaser, the latter being a rigorous method to avoid the well-known ultraviolet divergencies of quantum field theory. It will be shown that the theory is infrared divergent if the usual scattering states are used. The same is true if we use more general mixed states. This is in contradiction to the results established in the literature, and we will point out why these earlier approaches fail to describe the infrared behaviour correctly. We also calculate the thermal corrections to the electron magnetic moment in the low temperature approximation k_B T << m_e. This is done by investigating the scattering of an electron on a C-number potential in third order in the limit of small momentum transfer p -> q. We reproduce one of the different results reported up to now in literature. In the low temperature approximation infrared finiteness is recovered in a very straightforward way: In contrast to the literature we do not have to introduce a thermal Dirac equation or thermal spinors.

9912241;'From SYM Perturbation Theory to Closed Strings in Matrix Theory';'Micha Berkooz (Princeton University)';'Thu, 23 Dec 1999 17:44:14 GMT   (16kb)';'   For the purpose of better understanding the AdS/CFT correspondence it is useful to have a description of the theory for all values of the 't Hooft coupling, and for all $N$. We discuss such a description in the framework of Matrix theory for SYM on D4-branes, which is given in terms of quantum mechanics on the moduli space of solutions of the Nahm equations. This description reduces to both SYM perturbation theory and to closed string perturbation theory, each in its appropriate regime of validity, suggesting a way of directly relating the variables in the two descriptions. For example, it shows explicitly how holes in the world-sheets of the 't Hooft expansion close to give closed surfaces. '
9912242;'Metric Fluctuations in Brane Worlds';'M. G. Ivanov and I. V. Volovich';'Thu, 23 Dec 1999 19:38:38 GMT   (4kb)';'   Recently a realization of the four-dimensional gravity on a brane in five-dimensional spacetime has been discussed. Randall and Sundrum have shown that the equation for the longitudinal components of the metric fluctuations admit a normalizable zero mode solution, which has been interpreted as the localized gravity on the brane. We point out that the equation for the transverse components of the metric fluctuations has a solutions which is not localized on the brane. This indicates that probably the effective theory is unstable or, in other words, actually it is not four-dimensional but five-dimensional. Perhaps a modification of the proposal by using matter fields can lead to the trapping of gravity to the brane. '
9912243;'Off-shell structure of the string sigma model';'Alan Kostelecky, Malcolm Perry, Robertus Potting';'Thu, 23 Dec 1999 21:41:50 GMT   (51kb)';'   The off-shell structure of the string sigma model is investigated. In the open bosonic string, nonperturbative effects are shown to depend crucially on the regularization scheme. A scheme retaining the notion of string width reproduces the structure of Witten's string field theory and the associated unconventional gauge transformations. '
9912244;'On the Critical Behavior of D1-brane Theories';'Eva Silverstein and Yun S. Song';'Fri, 24 Dec 1999 00:10:22 GMT   (27kb)';'   We study renormalization-group flow patterns in theories arising on D1-branes in various supersymmetry-breaking backgrounds. We argue that the theory of N D1-branes transverse to an orbifold space can be fine-tuned to flow to the corresponding orbifold conformal field theory in the infrared, for particular values of the couplings and theta angles which we determine using the discrete symmetries of the model. By calculating various nonplanar contributions to the scalar potential in the worldvolume theory, we show that fine-tuning is in fact required at finite N, as would be generically expected. We further comment on the presence of singular conformal field theories (such as those whose target space includes a ``throat'' described by an exactly solvable CFT) in the non-supersymmetric context. Throughout the analysis two applications are considered: to gauge theory/gravity duality and to linear sigma model techniques for studying worldsheet string theory. '
9912245;'Analytical results for string propagation near a Kaluza-Klein black hole';'H. K. Jassal and A. Mukherjee (University of Delhi, India)';'Fri, 24 Dec 1999 06:11:12 GMT   (6kb)';'   This brief report presents analytical solutions to the equations of motion of a null string. The background spacetime is a magnetically charged Kaluza-Klein black hole. The string coordinates are expanded with the world-sheet velocity of light as an expansion parameter. It is shown that the zeroth order solutions can be expressed in terms of elementary functions in an appropriate large distance approximation. In addition, a class of exact solutions corresponding to the Pollard-Gross-Perry-Sorkin monopole case is also obtained. '
9912246;'On the Gravitational Scaling Dimensions';'H.W. Hamber';'Fri, 24 Dec 1999 06:09:02 GMT   (105kb)';'   A model for quantized gravitation based on the simplicial lattice discretization is studied in detail using a comprehensive finite size scaling analysis combined with renormalization group methods. The results are consistent with a value for the universal critical exponent for gravitation $\nu=1/3$, and suggest a simple relationship between Newton's constant, the gravitational correlation length and the observable average space-time curvature. Some perhaps testable phenomenological implications of these results are discussed. To achieve a high numerical accuracy in the evaluation of the lattice path integral a dedicated parallel machine was assembled. '
9912247;'A note on the BRST cohomology of the extended antifield formalism';'Glenn Barnich';'Fri, 24 Dec 1999 14:21:34 GMT   (10kb)';'   The relevance of the BRST cohomology of the extended antifield formalism is briefly discussed along with standard homological tools needed for its computation. '
9912248;'Dimensional renormalization of Yukawa theories wia Wilsonian methods';'M. Pernici, M. Raciti, F. Riva';'Fri, 24 Dec 1999 15:45:18 GMT   (411kb)';'   In the 't Hooft-Veltman dimensional regularization scheme it is necessary to introduce finite counterterms to satisfy chiral Ward identities. It is a non-trivial task to evaluate these counterterms even at two loops. We suggest the use of Wilsonian exact renormalization group techniques to reduce the computation of these counterterms to simple master integrals. We illustrate this method by a detailed study of a generic Yukawa model with massless fermions at two loops. '
9912249;'Tachyon condensation in string field theory';'Ashoke Sen and Barton Zwiebach';'Fri, 24 Dec 1999 21:56:09 GMT   (13kb)';'   It has been conjectured that at a stationary point of the tachyon potential for the D-brane of bosonic string theory, the negative energy density exactly cancels the D-brane tension. We evaluate this tachyon potential by off-shell calculations in open string field theory. Surprisingly, the condensation of the tachyon mode alone into the stationary point of its cubic potential is found to cancel about 70% of the D-brane tension. Keeping relevant scalars up to four mass levels above the tachyon, the energy density at the shifted stationary point cancels 99% of the D-brane tension. '
9912250;'Non-renormalization of next-to-extremal correlators in N=4 SYM and the';'J. Erdmenger, M. Perez-Victoria';'Sun, 26 Dec 1999 13:25:08 GMT   (37kb)';'   We show that next-to-extremal correlators of chiral primary operators in N=4 SYM theory do not receive quantum corrections to first order in perturbation theory. Furthermore we consider next-to-extremal correlators within AdS supergravity. Here the exchange diagrams contributing to these correlators yield results of the same free-field form as obtained within field theory. This suggests that quantum corrections vanish at strong coupling as well. '

Stroganov (IFVE, Protvino; RIMS, Kyoto),';'Mon, 27 Dec 1999 01:47:20 GMT   (7kb)';'   We find an analytic solution of the Bethe Ansatz equations (BAE) for the special case of a finite XXZ spin chain with free boundary conditions and with a complex surface field which provides for $U_q(sl(2))$ symmetry of the Hamiltonian. More precisely, we find one nontrivial solution, corresponding to the ground state of the system with anisotropy parameter $\Delta = {1/2}$ corresponding to $q^3 = -1$. '
9912253;'Note on the Gauge Fixing in Gauge Theory';'Kazuo Fujikawa and Hiroaki Terashima, (Dept. of Physics, Univ. of';'Mon, 27 Dec 1999 07:24:32 GMT   (9kb)';'   In the absence of Gribov complications, the modified gauge fixing in gauge theory $ \int{\cal D}A_{\mu}\{\exp[-S_{YM}(A_{\mu})-\int f(A_{\mu})dx] /\int{\cal D}g\exp[-\int f(A_{\mu}^{g})dx]\}$ for example, $f(A_{\mu})=(1/2)(A_{\mu})^{2}$, is identical to the conventional Faddeev-Popov formula $\int{\cal D}A_{\mu}\{\delta(D^{\mu}\frac{\delta f(A_{\nu})}{\delta A_{\mu}})/\int {\cal D}g\delta(D^{\mu}\frac{\delta f(A_{\nu}^{g})} {\delta A_{\mu}^{g}})\}\exp[-S_{YM}(A_{\mu})]$ if one takes into account the variation of the gauge field along the entire gauge orbit. Despite of its quite different appearance,the modified formula defines a local and BRST invariant theory and thus ensures unitarity at least in perturbation theory. In the presence of Gribov complications, as is expected in non-perturbative Yang-Mills theory, the modified formula is equivalent to the conventional formula but not identical to it:Both of the definitions give rise to non-local theory in general and thus the unitarity is not obvious. Implications of the present analysis on the lattice regularization are briefly discussed. '
9912254;'Witten's Open String Field Theory in Constant B-Field Background';'Fumihiko Sugino';'Mon, 27 Dec 1999 11:00:53 GMT   (25kb)';'   In this paper we consider Witten's bosonic open string field theory in the presence of a constant background of the second-rank antisymmetric tensor field $B_{ij}$. We extend the operator formulation of Gross and Jevicki in this situation and construct the overlap vertices explicitly. As a result we find a noncommutative structure of the Moyal type only in the zero-mode sector, which is consistent with the result of the correlation functions among vertex operators in the world sheet formulation. Furthermore we find out a certain unitary transformation of the string field which absorbs the Moyal type noncommutative structure. It can be regarded as a microscopic origin of the transformation between the gauge fields in commutative and noncommutative gauge theories discussed by Seiberg and Witten. '
9912255;'Spontaneously Broken Space-Time Supersymmetry in Open String Theory';'Tamiaki Yoneya';'Mon, 27 Dec 1999 15:01:31 GMT   (22kb)';'   We argue that orientable open string theory without GSO projection has N=2 space-time supersymmetry in a spontaneously broken phase. The arguments are presented both in Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond and Green-Schwarz formulations. The formal but explicit supersymmetry transformation law for string field is given in the framework of Witten's open string field theory. Our results support a fundamental assumption which lies behind the topological construction of stable D-branes starting from the unstable systems of D9-branes. '

Marchioro';'Mon, 27 Dec 1999 17:17:51 GMT   (8kb)';'   The zero-hamiltonian problem, present in reparametrization invariant systems, is solved for the 2-D induced gravity model. Working with methods developed by Henneaux et al. we find systematically the reduced phase-space physics, generated by an {\it effective} hamiltonian obtained after complete gauge fixing. '
9912257;'Non-Tachyonic Type 0B Orientifolds, Non-Supersymmetric Gauge Theories';'Carlo Angelantonj (ENS) and Adi Armoni (Ecole Polytechnique)';'Mon, 27 Dec 1999 17:33:09 GMT   (23kb)';'   We discuss gauge theories on D3 branes embedded in special non-tachyonic orientifolds of the 0B string theory. In general, they correspond to non-supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theories with scalars in the adjoint representation and spinors in the (anti-)symmetric representation. We study these theories via the AdS/CFT correspondence and present evidence of their relation to N=4 SYM in the planar limit. We also discuss finite N properties, focusing in particular on the renormalization group flow. Up to two loops, the logarithmic running of the gauge coupling is described by the dilaton tadpole and the cosmological constant that naturally emerge on the string theory side. '
9912258;'IIB Matrix Model with D1-D5 Backgrounds';'Yusuke Kimura and Yoshihisa Kitazawa';'Mon, 27 Dec 1999 18:03:35 GMT   (15kb)';'   We consider IIB matrix model with D1-D5-brane backgrounds. Using the fact that noncommutative gauge theory on the D-branes can be obtained as twisted reduced model in IIB matrix model, we study two-dimensional gauge theory on D1-branes and D5-branes. Especially the spectrum of the zero modes in the off-diagonal parts is examined. We also consider the description of D1-branes as local excitations of gauge theory on D5-branes. Relation to supergravity solution is also discussed. '
9912259;'Charged Rotating Black Hole in Three Spacetime Dimensions';'Cristian Martinez, Claudio Teitelboim and Jorge Zanelli';'Mon, 27 Dec 1999 18:18:47 GMT   (21kb)';'   The generalization of the black hole in three-dimensional spacetime to include an electric charge Q in addition to the mass M and the angular momentum J is given. The field equations are first solved explicitly when Q is small and the general form of the field at large distances is established. The total ``hairs'' M, J and Q are exhibited as boundary terms at infinity. It is found that the inner horizon of the rotating uncharged black hole is unstable under the addition of a small electric charge. Next it is shown that when Q=0 the spinning black hole may be obtained from the one with J=0 by a Lorentz boost in the $\phi -t$ plane. This boost is an ``illegitimate coordinate transformation'' because it changes the physical parameters of the solution. The extreme black hole appears as the analog of a particle moving with the speed of light. The same boost may be used when $Q\neq 0$ to generate a solution with angular momentum from that with J=0, although the geometrical meaning of the transformation is much less transparent since in the charged case the black holes are not obtained by identifying points in anti-de Sitter space. The metric is given explicitly in terms of three parameters, $\widetilde{M}$, $ \widetilde{Q}$ and $\omega $ which are the ``rest mass'' and ``rest charge'' and the angular velocity of the boost. These parameters are related to M, J and Q through the solution of an algebraic cubic equation. Altogether, even without angular momentum, the electrically charged 2+1 black hole is somewhat pathological since (i) it exists for arbitrarily negative values of the mass, and (ii) there is no upper bound on the electric charge.

9912262;'Exact Symmetries realized on the Renormalized Group Flow';'Yuji Igarashi, Katsumi Itoh and Hiroto So';'Tue, 28 Dec 1999 09:59:02 GMT   (12kb)';'   We show that symmetries are preserved exactly along the (Wilsonian) renormalization group flow, though the IR cutoff deforms concrete forms of the transformations. For a gauge theory the cutoff dependent Ward-Takahashi identity is written as the master equation in the antifield formalism: one may read off the renormalized BRS transformation from the master equation. The Maxwell theory is studied explicitly to see how it works. The renormalized BRS transformation becomes non-local but keeps off-shell nilpotency. Our formalism is applicable for a generic global symmetry. The master equation considered for the chiral symmetry provides us with the continuum analog of the Ginsparg-Wilson relation and the L{\" u}scher's symmetry. '
9912263;'ADM approach to 2+1 dimensional gravity';'Pietro Menotti (Department of Physics, University of Pisa, Italy),';'Tue, 28 Dec 1999 13:29:35 GMT   (15kb)';'   The canonical ADM equations are solved in terms of the conformal factor in the instantaneous York gauge. A simple derivation is given for the solution of the two body problem. A geometrical characterization is given for the apparent singularities occurring in the N-body problem and it is shown how the Garnier hamiltonian system arises in the ADM treatment by considering the time development of the conformal factor at the locations where the extrinsic curvature tensor vanishes. The equations of motion for the position of the particles and of the apparent singularities and also the time dependence of the linear residues at such singularities are given by the transformation induced by an energy momentum tensor of a conformal Liouville theory. Such an equation encodes completely the dynamics of the system. '

Extra coordinates of the superspace associated with tensorial central charges are shown to describe spin degrees of freedom of the superparticle, so quantum states form an infinite tower of (half)-integer helicities. A peculiar feature of the model is that it admits BPS states which preserve 3/4 of target-space supersymmetries. '

A multiple of this product is shown to reduce to a path-integral quantization in the continuous time limit. In flat space the action becomes the one of free bosonic strings. Relation to Kontsevich prescription is also discussed. '

We solve the condition of preserved supersymmetry on a metric inspired by the deformed conifold metric and obtain a solution of the NS5-branes which is delocalized except for one of the overall transverse directions. The solution has consistent properties with other configurations obtained by string dualities. '
9912267;'On the relation between Euclidean and Lorentzian 2D quantum gravity';'J. Ambjorn, J. Correia, C. Kristjansen (NBI) and R. Loll (AEI)';'Wed, 29 Dec 1999 12:48:56 GMT   (18kb)';'   Starting from 2D Euclidean quantum gravity, we show that one recovers 2D Lorentzian quantum gravity by removing all baby universes. Using a peeling procedure to decompose the discrete, triangulated geometries along a one-dimensional path, we explicitly associate with each Euclidean space-time a (generalized) Lorentzian space-time. This motivates a map between the parameter spaces of the two theories, under which their propagators get identified. In two dimensions, Lorentzian quantum gravity can therefore be viewed as a ``renormalized'' version of Euclidean quantum gravity. '
9912268;'Yang-Mills Theory in Three Dimensions as Quantum Gravity Theory';'Dmitri Diakonov and Victor Petrov';'Wed, 29 Dec 1999 18:37:41 GMT   (43kb)';'   We perform the dual transformation of the Yang-Mills theory in d=3 dimensions using the Wilson action on the cubic lattice. The dual lattice is made of tetrahedra triangulating a 3-dimensional curved manifold but embedded into a flat 6-dimensional space (for the SU(2) gauge group). In the continuum limit the theory can be reformulated in terms of 6-component gauge-invariant scalar fields having the meaning of the external coordinates of the dual lattice sites. These 6-component fields induce a metric and a curvature of the 3-dimensional dual colour space. The Yang-Mills theory can be identically rewritten as a quantum gravity theory with the Einstein-Hilbert action but purely imaginary Newton constant, plus a homogeneous `matter' term. Interestingly, the theory can be formulated in a gauge-invariant and local form without explicit colour degrees of freedom. '

Dalmazi, A. de Souza Dutra and Marcelo Hott';'Wed, 29 Dec 1999 19:29:32 GMT   (37kb)';'   We calculate the effective action for Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) in D=2,3 dimensions at the quadratic approximation in the gauge fields. We analyse the analytic structure of the corresponding nonlocal boson propagators nonperturbatively in k/m. In two dimensions for any nonzero fermion mass, we end up with one massless pole for the gauge boson . We also calculate in D=2 the effective potential between two static charges separated by a distance L and find it to be a linearly increasing function of L in agreement with the bosonized theory (massive Sine-Gordon model). In three dimensions we find nonperturbatively in k/m one massive pole in the effective bosonic action leading to screening. Fitting the numerical results we derive a simple expression for the functional dependence of the boson mass upon the dimensionless parameter e^{2}/m . '
9912270;'Yang-Lee Zeros of the Ising model on Random Graphs of Non Planar';'Luiz C. de Albuquerque, Nelson A. Alves and D. Dalmazi';'Wed, 29 Dec 1999 19:54:56 GMT   (49kb)';'   We obtain in a closed form the 1/N^2 contribution to the free energy of the two Hermitian N\times N random matrix model with non symmetric quartic potential. From this result, we calculate numerically the Yang-Lee zeros of the 2D Ising model on dynamical random graphs with the topology of a torus up to n=16 vertices. They are found to be located on the unit circle on the complex fugacity plane. In order to include contributions of even higher topologies we calculated analytically the nonperturbative (sum over all genus) partition function of the model Z_n = \sum_{h=0}^{\infty} \frac{Z_n^{(h)}}{N^{2h}} for the special cases of N=1,2 and graphs with n\le 20 vertices. Once again the Yang-Lee zeros are shown numerically to lie on the unit circle on the complex fugacity plane. Our results thus generalize previous numerical results on random graphs by going beyond the planar approximation and strongly indicate that there might be a generalization of the Lee-Yang circle theorem for dynamical random graphs.

The quiver diagram of $\ZnZn \in SU(3)$ can be expressed in three-dimensional form. According to the correspondence between quiver diagrams and brane configurations, we construct a brane configuration for ${\bf C}^3/\ZnZn$ which has essentially three-dimensional structrue.

We construct the string field theory in the operator formalism and find that, compared to the ordinary theory with no B field, the vertices in the resulting theory has an additional factor. The factor makes the zero modes of strings noncommutative. This is in agreement with the results in the first-quantized formulation. We also discuss background independence of the purely cubic action derived from the above string field theory and then find a redefinition of string fields to remove the additional factor from the vertex. Furthermore, we briefly discuss the supersymmetric extension of our string field theory. '
9912275;'D branes in string theory, II';'Paolo Di Vecchia and Antonella Liccardo';'Thu, 30 Dec 1999 12:27:14 GMT   (53kb)';'   In these lectures we review the properties of a boosted and rotated boundary state and of a boundary state with an abelian gauge field deriving from it the Dirac-Born-Infeld action and a newly constructed class of classical solutions. We also review the construction of the boundary state for the stable non-BPS state of type I theory corresponding to the perturbative state present at the first excited level of the SO(32) heterotic string and transforming according to the spinor representation of SO(32) (Lectures presented at the YITP Workshop on ``Developments in Superstring and M-theory'', Kyoto, Japan, October 1999).

9912276;'Four-Dimensional Planck Scale is Not Universal in Fifth Dimension in';'Takaaki Ozeki and Noriyuki Shimoyama';'Thu, 30 Dec 1999 13:18:57 GMT   (8kb)';'   It has recently been proposed that the hierarchy problem can be solved by considering the warped fifth dimension compactified on $S^{1}/Z_{2}$. Many studies in the context have assumed a particular choice for an integration constant $\sigma_{0}$ that appears when one solves the five-dimensional Einstein equation. Since $\sigma_{0}$ is not determined by the boundary condition of the five-dimensional theory, $\sigma_{0}$ may be regarded as a gauge degree of freedom in a sense. To this time, all indications are that the four-dimensional Planck mass depends on $\sigma_{0}$. In this paper, we carefully investigate the properties of the geometry in the Randall-Sundrum model, and consider in which location $y$ the four-dimensional Planck mass is measured. As a result, we find a $\sigma_{0}$-independent relation between the four-dimensional Planck mass $M_{\rm Pl}$ and five- dimensional fundamental mass scale $M$, and remarkably enough, we can take $M$ to TeV region when we consider models with the Standard Model confined on a distant brane. We also confirm that the physical masses on the distant brane do not depend on $\sigma_{0}$ by considering a bulk scalar field as an illustrative example. The resulting mass scale of the Kaluza-Klein modes is on the order of $M$. '
9912277;'On G/H geometry and its use in M-theory compactifications';'Leonardo Castellani';'Thu, 30 Dec 1999 17:36:34 GMT   (15kb)';'   The Riemannian geometry of coset spaces is reviewed, with emphasis on its applications to supergravity and M-theory compactifications. Formulae for the connection and curvature of rescaled coset manifolds are generalized to the case of nondiagonal Killing metrics.   The example of the N^{010} spaces is discussed in detail. These are a subclass of the coset manifolds N^{pqr}=G/H = SU(3) x U(1)/U(1) x U(1), the integers p,q,r characterizing the embedding of H in G. We study the realization of N^{010} as G/H=SU(3) x SU(2)/U(1) x SU(2) (with diagonal embedding of the SU(2) \in H into G). For a particular G-symmetric rescaling there exist three Killing spinors, implying N=3 supersymmetry in the AdS_4 \times N^{010} compactification of D=11 supergravity. This rescaled N^{010} space is of particular interest for the AdS_4/CFT_3 correspondence, and its SU(3) x SU(2) isometric realization is essential for the OSp(4|3) classification of the Kaluza-Klein modes.

9912278;'Semi-naive dimensional renormalization';'M. Pernici';'Thu, 30 Dec 1999 17:28:12 GMT   (27kb)';'   We propose a treatment of $\gamma^5$ in dimensional regularization which is based on an algebraically consistent extension of the Breitenlohner-Maison-'t Hooft-Veltman (BMHV) scheme; we define the corresponding minimal renormalization scheme and show its equivalence with a non-minimal BMHV scheme. The restoration of the chiral Ward identities requires the introduction of considerably fewer finite counterterms than in the BMHV scheme. This scheme is the same as the minimal naive dimensional renormalization in the case of diagrams not involving fermionic traces with an odd number of $\gamma^5$, but unlike the latter it is a consistent scheme. As a simple example we apply our minimal subtraction scheme to the Yukawa model at two loops in presence of external gauge fields. '
9912279;'Self-Duality, Ramond-Ramond Fields, and K-Theory';'Gregory Moore and Edward Witten';'Thu, 30 Dec 1999 20:57:16 GMT   (31kb)';'   Just as D-brane charge of Type IIA and Type IIB superstrings is classified, respectively, by K^1(X) and K(X), Ramond-Ramond fields in these theories are classified, respectively, by K(X) and K^1(X). By analyzing a recent proposal for how to interpret quantum self-duality of RR fields, we show that the Dirac quantization formula for the RR p-forms, when properly formulated, receives corrections that reflect curvature, lower brane charges, and an anomaly of D-brane world-volume fermions. The K-theory framework is important here, because the term involving the fermion anomaly cannot be naturally expressed in terms of cohomology and differential forms. '
9912280;'Coordinate-Free Action for AdS3 Higher-Spin-Matter Systems';'Sergey Prokushkin (1), Arkady Segal (2), and Mikhail Vasiliev (2) ((1)';'Thu, 30 Dec 1999 22:01:00 GMT   (15kb)';'   A coordinate-free action principle for the N=2 supersymmetric model of spin 0 and spin 1/2 matter fields interacting via Chern-Simons higher spin gauge fields in AdS3 is formulated in terms of star-product algebra of two oscillators. Although describing proper relativistic dynamics the action does not contain space-time coordinates. It is given by a supertrace of a forth-order polynomial in the 3d higher spin superalgebra. The theory admits a free parameter characterizing the inequivalent vacua associated with the parameter of mass m of the matter fields. For the case of the massless matter, the model has a form of the noncommutative 2d Yang-Mills theory with some infinite-dimensional gauge group. The limit m\to\infty corresponds to the SU(\infty) 2d Yang-Mills theory. '

9912282;'Reparametrization Invariance and the Schr\"odinger Equation';'V.I. Tkach, A. Pashnev and J.J. Rosales';'Thu, 30 Dec 1999 23:20:07 GMT   (14kb)';'   In the present work we consider a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for systems invariant under the reparametrization of time. We develop the two-stage procedure of construction such systems from a given initial ones, which is not invariant under the time reparametrization. One of the first-class constraints of the systems in such description becomes the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The procedure is applicable in the supersymmetric theories as well. The $n=2$ supersymmetric quantum mechanics is coupled to world-line supergravity, and the local supersymmetric action is constructed leading to the square root representation of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation.

9912283;'A Heavy Fermion Can Create a Soliton: A 1+1 Dimensional Example';'E. Farhi, N. Graham, R. L. Jaffe, H. Weigel';'Thu, 30 Dec 1999 23:58:18 GMT   (22kb)';'   We show that quantum effects can stabilize a soliton in a model with no soliton at the classical level. The model has a scalar field chirally coupled to a fermion in 1+1 dimensions. We use a formalism that allows us to calculate the exact one loop fermion contribution to the effective energy for a spatially varying scalar background. This energy includes the contribution from counterterms fixed in the perturbative sector of the theory. The resulting energy is therefore finite and unambiguous. A variational search then yields a fermion number one configuration whose energy is below that of a single free fermion. '
9912284;'On the Gauge Fixing of the k Symmetry on AdS and Flat Background: the';'Igor Pesando';'Fri, 31 Dec 1999 00:01:29 GMT   (11kb)';'   We explore all the possible ways of fixing the kappa symmetry for both branes and strings by means of a constant projector. We find that they can be classified according to their behaviour under Dirac conjugation and conjugation. This latter controls the maximum power of the fermionic variables in which the (super)vielbein can be expanded while the former determines which states cannot be described in the gauge. In particular there exists an interesting class of projectors for which vielbein are at most quadratic in the fermionic variables. As an example we compute the action for the type IIb on a AdS_{5} X S_{5} background with a lightcone-like projector; this action reduces to the usual lightcone GS string action in the flat limit. '
9912285;'Dimensional reduction, magnetic flux strings, and domain walls';'C. D. Fosco, A. Lopez and F. A. Schaposnik';'Fri, 31 Dec 1999 00:07:07 GMT   (21kb)';'   We study some consequences of dimensionally reducing systems with massless fermions and Abelian gauge fields from 3+1 to 2+1 dimensions. We first consider fermions in the presence of an external Abelian gauge field. In the reduced theory, obtained by compactifying one of the coordinates `a la Kaluza-Klein, magnetic flux strings are mapped into domain wall defects. Fermionic zero modes, localized around the flux strings of the 3+1 dimensional theory, become also zero modes in the reduced theory, via the Callan and Harvey mechanism, and are concentrated around the domain wall defects. We also study a dynamical model: massless $QED_4$, with fermions confined to a plane, deriving the effective action that describes the `planar' system. '
9912286;'Exact Renormalized One-Loop Quantum Corrections to Energies of Solitonic';'N. Graham';'Fri, 31 Dec 1999 00:20:15 GMT   (414kb)';'   We develop a method for computing exact one-loop quantum corrections to the energies of static classical backgrounds in renormalizable quantum field theories. We use a continuum density of states formalism to construct a regularized Casimir energy in terms of phase shifts and their Born approximations. This method unambiguously incorporates definite counterterms fixed in the standard way by physical renormalization conditions. The result is a robust computation that can be efficiently implemented both numerically and analytically. We carry out such calculations in models of bosons and fermions in one and three dimensions.

9912287;'Global structure of exact cosmological solutions in the brane world';'Shinji Mukohyama, Tetsuya Shiromizu, Kei-ichi Maeda';'Fri, 31 Dec 1999 03:44:03 GMT   (24kb)';'   We find the explicit coordinate transformation which links two exact cosmological solutions of the brane world which have been recently discovered. This means that both solutions are exactly the same with each other. One of two solutions is described by the motion of a domain wall in the well-known 5-dimensional Schwarzshild-AdS spacetime. Hence, we can easily understand the region covered by the coordinate used by another solution. '
9912288;'S-wave absorption of scalars by noncommutative D3-branes';'Y.S. Myung, Gungwon Kang, H.W. Lee (Inje University)';'Fri, 31 Dec 1999 05:24:41 GMT   (15kb)';'   On the supergravity side, we study the propagation of the RR scalar and the dilaton in the D3-branes with NS $B$-field. To obtain the noncommutative effect, we consider the case of $B\to \infty(\theta \to\pi/2)$. We approximate this as the smeared D1-brane background with $F_5=H=0$. In this background, the RR scalar induces an instability of the near-horizon geometry. However, it turns out that the RR scalar is nonpropagating, while the dilaton is a physically propagating mode. We calculate the s-wave absorption cross section of the dilaton. One finds $\sigma_0^\phi |_{B\to\infty} \sim (\tilde \omega \tilde R_{\pi \over 2})^{8.9} / \omega^5$ in the leading-order while $\sigma_0^\phi|_{B=0} \sim (\tilde \omega R_0)^{8}/\omega^5$ in the D3-branes without $B$-field. This means that although the dilaton belongs to a minimally coupled scalar in the absence of $B$-field, it becomes a sort of fixed scalar in the limit of $B \to \infty$. '
9912289;'Gauge Fixing in the Chain by Chain Method';'A Shirzad and F Loran';'Fri, 31 Dec 1999 22:45:43 GMT   (12kb)';'   In a recent work we showed that for a Hamiltonian system with constraints, the set of constraints can be investigated in first and second class constraint chains. We show here that using this "chain by chain" method for an arbitrary system one can fix the gauges in the most economical and consistent way. We show that it is enough to assume some gauge fixing conditions conjugate to last elements of first class chains. The remaining necessary conditions would emerge from consistency conditions. '

Krivonos';'Fri, 31 Dec 1999 15:50:07 GMT   (10kb)';'   We construct the worldline superfield massive superparticle actions which preserve 1/4 portion of the underlying higher-dimensional supersymmetry. We consider the cases of N=4/N=1 and N=8/N=2 partial breaking. In the first case we present the corresponding Green-Schwarz type target superspace action with one kappa supersymmetry. In the second case we find out two possibilities, one of which is a direct generalization of the N=4/N=1 case, while another is essentially different. '
9912293;'Corrections to the Abelian Born-Infeld Action Arising from';'L. Cornalba (I.H.E.S.)';'Fri, 31 Dec 1999 19:25:54 GMT   (12kb)';'   In a recent paper Seiberg and Witten have argued that the full action describing the dynamics of coincident branes in the weak coupling regime is invariant under a specific field redefinition, which replaces the group of ordinary gauge transformations with the one of noncommutative gauge theory. This paper represents a first step towards the classification of invariant actions, in the simpler setting of the abelian single brane theory. In particular we consider a simplified model, in which the group of noncommutative gauge transformations is replaced with the group of symplectic diffeomorphisms of the brane world volume. We carefully define what we mean, in this context, by invariant actions, and rederive the known invariance of the Born-Infeld volume form. With the aid of a simple algebraic tool, which is a generalization of the Poisson bracket on the brane world volume, we are then able to describe invariant actions with an arbitrary number of derivatives.
